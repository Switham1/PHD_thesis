  ABSTRACT = {The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://arabidopsis.org) is a genome database for Arabidopsis thaliana, an important reference organism for many fundamental aspects of biology as well as basic and applied plant biology research. TAIR serves as a central access point for Arabidopsis data, annotates gene function and expression patterns using controlled vocabulary terms, and maintains and updates the A. thaliana genome assembly and annotation. TAIR also provides researchers with an extensive set of visualization and analysis tools. Recent developments include several new genome releases (TAIR8, TAIR9 and TAIR10) in which the A. thaliana assembly was updated, pseudogenes and transposon genes were re-annotated, and new data from proteomics and next generation transcriptome sequencing were incorporated into gene models and splice variants. Other highlights include progress on functional annotation of the genome and the release of several new tools including Textpresso for Arabidopsis which provides the capability to carry out full text searches on a large body of research literature.},

@ARTICLE{omalleyCistromeEpicistromeFeatures2016,
  ABSTRACT = {The cistrome is the complete set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) in an organism, while an epicistrome incorporates tissue-specific DNA chemical modifications and TF-specific chemical sensitivities into these binding profiles. Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that {$>$}75\% (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape. DAP-seq datasets also yielded insight into the biology and binding site architecture of numerous TFs, demonstrating the value of DAP-seq for cost-effective cistromic and epicistromic annotation in any organism.,},

@ARTICLE{yanaiGenomewideMidrangeTranscription2005,
  ABSTRACT = {Motivation: Genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.Results: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62\,839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index {$\tau$}, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15 \&lt; {$\tau$} \&lt; 0.85 were found to constitute \&gt;50\% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the IB tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12 - IB tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with IB = 2–11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.Availability: All data and analyses are publically available at the GeneNote website Supplementary information: Four tables available at the above site.},

  ABSTRACT = {Inventors in the field of mechanical and electronic engineering can access multitudes of components and, thanks to standardization, parts from different manufacturers can be used in combination with each other. The introduction of BioBrick standards for the assembly of characterized DNA sequences was a landmark in microbial engineering, shaping the field of synthetic biology. Here, we describe a standard for Type IIS restriction endonuclease-mediated assembly, defining a common syntax of 12 fusion sites to enable the facile assembly of eukaryotic transcriptional units. This standard has been developed and agreed by representatives and leaders of the international plant science and synthetic biology communities, including inventors, developers and adopters of Type IIS cloning methods. Our vision is of an extensive catalogue of standardized, characterized DNA parts that will accelerate plant bioengineering.},

  ABSTRACT = {High efficiency methods for DNA assembly are based on sequence overlap between fragments or Type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage and ligation. These have enabled routine assembly of synthetic DNAs of increased size and complexity. However, these techniques require customisation, elaborate vector sets and serial manipulations for the different stages of assembly. We present Loop assembly, based on a recursive approach to DNA fabrication. Alternate use of two Type IIS restriction endonucleases and corresponding vector sets allows efficient and parallel assembly of large DNA circuits. Plasmids containing standard Level 0 parts can be assembled into circuits containing 1, 4, 16 or more genes by looping between the two vector sets. The vectors also contain modular sites for hybrid assembly using sequence overlap methods. Loop assembly provides a simple generalised solution for DNA construction with standardised parts. The cloning system is provided under an OpenMTA license for unrestricted sharing and open access.},

  ABSTRACT = {Parallel DNA assembly methods allow multiple fragments of DNA to be compiled in a desired order in a single reaction. Several methods enable the efficient one-step assembly of multiple DNA parts into a suitable plasmid acceptor at high efficiency. Type IIS-mediated assembly offers the specific advantage of a one-step reaction that does not require proprietary reagents or the amplification and purification of linear DNA fragments. Instead, multiple plasmids housing standardized DNA parts of interest are combined in an enzyme cocktail. To make these standard parts, DNA sequences with defined functions are assigned specific sequence features. This allows parts to be interoperable and reusable. The availability of collections of DNA parts and molecular toolkits that allow the facile assembly of multigene binary constructs and the establishment of standards for the creation of new parts means Type IIS-mediated assembly has become a powerful technology for modern plant molecular biologists. ©{} 2016 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  ABSTRACT = {The transient gene expression system using Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts has proven an important and versatile tool for conducting cell-based experiments using molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic approaches to analyze the functions of diverse signaling pathways and cellular machineries. A well-established protocol that has been extensively tested and applied in numerous experiments is presented here. The method includes protoplast isolation, PEG–calcium transfection of plasmid DNA and protoplast culture. Physiological responses and high-throughput capability enable facile and cost-effective explorations as well as hypothesis-driven tests. The protoplast isolation and DNA transfection procedures take 6–8 h, and the results can be obtained in 2–24 h. The cell system offers reliable guidelines for further comprehensive analysis of complex regulatory mechanisms in whole-plant physiology, immunity, growth and development.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mammalian promoters can be separated into two classes, conserved TATA box–enriched promoters, which initiate at a well-defined site, and more plastic, broad and evolvable CpG-rich promoters. We have sequenced tags corresponding to several hundred thousand transcription start sites (TSSs) in the mouse and human genomes, allowing precise analysis of the sequence architecture and evolution of distinct promoter classes. Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative N termini. Among the TSSs, we identified new start sites associated with the majority of exons and with 3{${'}$} UTRs. These data permit genome-scale identification of tissue-specific promoters and analysis of the cis-acting elements associated with them.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is vital to understand the conservation and evolution of gene promoter sequences in order to understand environmental adaptation. The level of promoter conservation varies greatly between housekeeping (HK) and tissue-specific (TS) genes, denoting differences in the strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here, we analyzed promoter conservation and evolution to exploit differential regulation between HK and TS genes. The analysis of conserved elements showed CpG islands, short tandem repeats and G-quadruplex sequences are highly enriched in HK promoters relative to TS promoters. In addition, the type and density of regulatory motifs in TS promoters are much higher than HK promoters, indicating that TS genes show more complex regulatory patterns than HK genes. Moreover, the evolutionary dynamics of promoters showed similar evolutionary trend to coding sequences. HK promoters suffer more stringent selective pressure in the long-term evolutionary process. HK genes tend to show increased upstream sequence conservation due to stringent selection pressures acting on the promoter regions. The specificity of TS gene expression may be due to complex regulatory motifs acting in different tissues or conditions. The results from this study can be used to deepen our understanding of adaptive evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Plant genomes contain a high proportion of duplicated genes as a result of numerous whole, segmental and local duplications. These duplications lead up to the formation of gene families, which are the usual material for many evolutionary studies. However, all characterized genomes include single-copy (unique) genes that have not received much attention. Unlike gene duplication, gene loss is not an unspecific mechanism but is rather influenced by a functional selection. In this context, we have established and used stringent criteria in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present in plant proteomes. Comparisons of unique genes in the green phylum were used to characterize the gene and protein features exhibited by both conserved and species-specific unique genes.},

  ABSTRACT = {CpG islands (CGIs) are one of the most widely studied regulatory features of the human genome, with critical roles in development and disease. Despite such significance and the original epigenetic definition, currently used CGI sets are typically predicted from DNA sequence characteristics. Although CGIs are deeply implicated in practical analyses of DNA methylation, recent studies have shown that such computational annotations suffer from inaccuracies. Here we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 10 diverse human tissues to identify a comprehensive, experimentally obtained, single-base resolution CGI catalog. In addition to the unparalleled annotation precision, our method is free from potential bias due to arbitrary sequence features or probe affinity differences. In addition to clarifying substantial false positives in the widely used University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) annotations, our study identifies numerous novel epigenetic loci. In particular, we reveal significant impact of transposable elements on the epigenetic regulatory landscape of the human genome and demonstrate ubiquitous presence of transcription initiation at CGIs, including alternative promoters in gene bodies and non-coding RNAs in intergenic regions. Moreover, coordinated DNA methylation and chromatin modifications mark tissue-specific enhancers at novel CGIs. Enrichment of specific transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq supports mechanistic roles of CGIs on the regulation of tissue-specific transcription. The new CGI catalog provides a comprehensive and integrated list of genomic hotspots of epigenetic regulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding plant gene promoter architecture has long been a challenge due to the lack of relevant large-scale data sets and analysis methods. Here, we present a publicly available, large-scale transcription start site (TSS) data set in plants using a high-resolution method for analysis of 5{${'}$} ends of mRNA transcripts. Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples. Using this data set, we grouped TSS reads into ``TSS tag clusters'' and categorized clusters into three spatial initiation patterns: narrow peak, broad with peak, and weak peak. We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad ``TATA-less'' promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements. We present results on the usage of these elements and provide our Plant PEAT Peaks (3PEAT) model that predicts the presence of TSSs directly from sequence.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cytosine methylation is important for transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation of endogenous genes, although the extent to which this DNA modification functions to regulate the genome is still unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive DNA methylation map of an entire genome, at 35 base pair resolution, using the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We find that pericentromeric heterochromatin, repetitive sequences, and regions producing small interfering RNAs are heavily methylated. Unexpectedly, over one-third of expressed genes contain methylation within transcribed regions, whereas only {$\sim$}5\% of genes show methylation within promoter regions. Interestingly, genes methylated in transcribed regions are highly expressed and constitutively active, whereas promoter-methylated genes show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression. Whole-genome tiling-array transcriptional profiling of DNA methyltransferase null mutants identified hundreds of genes and intergenic noncoding RNAs with altered expression levels, many of which may be epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation.},

@ARTICLE{yamamotoHeterogeneityArabidopsisCore2009,
  ABSTRACT = {Our limited understanding of plant promoters does not allow us to recognize any core promoter elements for the majority of plant promoters. To understand the promoter architecture of Arabidopsis, we used the combined approach of in silico detection of novel core promoter elements and large-scale determination of transcription start sites (TSSs). To this end, we developed a novel methodology for TSS identification, using a combination of the cap-trapper and massively parallel signature sequencing methods. This technique, CT-MPSS, allowed us to identify 158 237 Arabidopsis TSS tags corresponding to 38 311 TSS loci, which provides an opportunity for quantitative analysis of plant promoters. The expression characteristics of these promoters were analyzed with respect to core promoter elements detected by our in silico analyses, revealing that Arabidopsis promoters contain two main types of elements with exclusive characteristics, the TATA type and the GA type. The TATA-type promoters tend to be associated with the Y Patch and the Inr motif, and cause high expression with sharp-peak TSS clusters. By contrast, the GA type produces broad-type TSS clusters. Unlike mammalian promoters, plant promoters are not associated with CpG islands. However, plant-specific GA-type promoters share some characteristics with mammalian CpG-type promoters.},

@ARTICLE{waltherRegulatoryCodeTranscriptional2007,
  ABSTRACT = {Regulation of gene expression via specific cis-regulatory promoter elements has evolved in cellular organisms as a major adaptive mechanism to respond to environmental change. Assuming a simple model of transcriptional regulation, genes that are differentially expressed in response to a large number of different external stimuli should harbor more distinct regulatory elements in their upstream regions than do genes that only respond to few environmental challenges. We tested this hypothesis in Arabidopsis thaliana using the compendium of gene expression profiling data available in AtGenExpress and known cis-element motifs mapped to upstream gene promoter regions and studied the relation of the observed breadth of differential gene expression response with several fundamental genome architectural properties. We observed highly significant positive correlations between the density of cis-elements in upstream regions and the number of conditions in which a gene was differentially regulated. The correlation was most pronounced in regions immediately upstream of the transcription start sites. Multistimuli response genes were observed to be associated with significantly longer upstream intergenic regions, retain more paralogs in the Arabidopsis genome, are shorter, have fewer introns, and are more likely to contain TATA-box motifs in their promoters. In abiotic stress time series data, multistimuli response genes were found to be overrepresented among early-responding genes. Genes involved in the regulation of transcription, stress response, and signaling processes were observed to possess the greatest regulatory capacity. Our results suggest that greater gene expression regulatory complexity appears to be encoded by an increased density of cis-regulatory elements and provide further evidence for an evolutionary adaptation of the regulatory code at the genomic layout level. Larger intergenic spaces preceding multistimuli response genes may have evolved to allow greater regulatory gene expression potential.},

In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.},

@ARTICLE{vinogradovDNAHelixImportance2017,
  ABSTRACT = {The AT-rich DNA is mostly associated with condensed chromatin, whereas the GC-rich sequence is preferably located in the dispersed chromatin. The AT-rich genes are prone to be tissue-specific (silenced in most tissues), while the GC-rich genes tend to be housekeeping (expressed in many tissues). This paper reports another important property of DNA base composition, which can affect repertoire of genes with high AT content. The GC-rich sequence is more liable to mutation. We found that Spearman correlation between human gene GC content and mutation probability is above 0.9. The change of base composition even in synonymous sites affects mutation probability of nonsynonymous sites and thus of encoded proteins. There is a unique type of housekeeping genes, which are especially unsafe when prone to mutation. Natural selection which usually removes deleterious mutations, in the case of these genes only increases the hazard because it can descend to suborganismal (cellular) level. These are cell cycle-related genes. In accordance with the proposed concept, they have low GC content of synonymous sites (despite them being housekeeping). The gene-centred protein interaction enrichment analysis (PIEA) showed the core clusters of genes whose interactants are modularly enriched in genes with AT-rich synonymous codons. This interconnected network is involved in double-strand break repair, DNA integrity checkpoints and chromosome pairing at mitosis. The damage of these genes results in genome and chromosome instability leading to cancer and other `error catastrophes'. Reducing the nonsynonymous mutations, the usage of AT-rich synonymous codons can decrease probability of cancer by above 20-fold.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mapping DNase-I hypersensitive sites (HS) was used in the past to identify regulatory elements of specific genes. More recently, thousands of HS were identified in the human genome by using high-throughput methods. These approaches showed a general enrichment of HS near or within known genes, within CpG islands, within human–mouse conserved regions and in GC-rich regions of the genome. Here we show that HS: (i) are characterized by a much higher GC level (\textasciitilde 56\%) than the average GC level of the human genome (\textasciitilde 41\%); (ii) are overwhelmingly located in the GC-richest compartment of the genome, which is predominantly associated with an open chromatin structure; (iii) and are slightly more and slightly less frequent than genes, respectively, in the gene-rich and in the gene-poor isochore families.},

@ARTICLE{mattioliHighthroughputFunctionalAnalysis2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Transcription initiates at both coding and noncoding genomic elements, including mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has a different expression profile with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than nondivergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue specificity is strongly associated with having less complex transcription factor (TF) motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity. Moreover, we find that 22\% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.},

@ARTICLE{theunePhylogeneticAnalysesGAGAMotif2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Plant GAGA-motif binding factors are encoded by the BARLEY B RECOMBINANT / BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BBR/BPC) family, which fulfill indispensable functions in growth and development. BBR/BPC proteins control flower development, size of the stem cell niche and seed development through transcriptional regulation of homeotic transcription factor genes. They are responsible for the context dependent recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) or other repressive proteins to GAGA-motifs, which are contained in Polycomb repressive DNA-elements (PREs). Hallmark of the protein family is the highly conserved BPC domain, which is required for DNA binding. Here we study the evolution and diversification of the BBR/BPC family and its DNA-binding domain. Our analyses supports a further division of the family into four main groups (I-IV) and several subgroups, to resolve a strict monophyletic descent of the BPC domain. We prove a polyphyletic origin for group III proteins, which evolved from group I and II members through extensive loss of domains in the N-terminus. Conserved motif searches lend to the identification of a WAKHGTN consensus and a TIR/K motif at the very C-terminus of the BPC-domain. We could show by DPI-ELISA that this signature is required for DNA-binding in AtBPC1. Additional binding studies with mutated oligonucleotides consolidated the binding to GAGA tetramers. To validate these findings, we used previously published ChIP-seq data from GFP-BPC6. We uncovered that many genes of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway are targeted by AtBPC6. Consistently, bpc6, bpc4 bpc6 and lhp1 bpc4 bpc4 mutants display brassinosteroid-dependent root growth phenotypes. Both, a function in brassinosteroid signaling and our phylogenetic data supports a link between BBR/BPC diversification in the land plant lineage and the complexity of flower and seed plant evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution. We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes. Here we present a comparison of five Drosophila genomes showing that HCNE density peaks centrally in large synteny blocks containing multiple genes. Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers, HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring genes. We describe differences in core promoters between the target genes and the unrelated genes that offer an explanation for the differences in their responsiveness to enhancers. We show examples of a striking correspondence between boundaries of synteny blocks, HCNE arrays, and Polycomb binding regions, confirming that the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes. The structural and functional equivalence between insect and vertebrate GRBs marks them as an ancient feature of metazoan genomes and as a key to future studies of development and gene regulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background Core promoters are the gene regulatory regions most proximal to the transcription start site (TSS), central to the formation of pre-initiation complexes and for combinatorial gene regulation. The DNA elements required for core promoter function in plants are poorly understood. To establish the sequence motifs that characterize plant core promoters and to compare them to the corresponding sequences in animals, we took advantage of available full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) and predicted upstream regulatory sequences to carry out the analysis of 12,749 Arabidopsis core promoters. Results Using a combination of expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling methods, we identified several motifs overrepresented in Arabidopsis core promoters. One of them corresponded to the TATA element, for which an in-depth analysis resulted in the generation of robust TATA Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFMs) capable of predicting Arabidopsis TATA elements with a high degree of confidence. We established that approximately 29\% of all Arabidopsis promoters contain TATA motifs, clustered around position -32 with respect to the TSS. The presence of TATA elements was associated with genes represented more frequently in EST collections and with shorter 5' UTRs. No cis-elements were found over-represented in TATA-less, compared to TATA-containing promoters. Conclusion Our studies provide a first genome-wide illustration of the composition and structure of core Arabidopsis promoters. The percentage of TATA-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized, yet comparable to the number of Drosophila promoters containing a TATA element. Although several other DNA elements were identified as over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters, they are present in only a small fraction of the genes and they represent elements not previously described in animals, suggesting a distinct architecture of the core promoters of plant and animal genes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Phenotypic diversity is generated through changes in gene structure or gene regulation. The availability of full genomic sequences allows for the analysis of gene sequence evolution. In contrast, little is known about the principles driving the evolution of gene expression. Here we describe the differential transcriptional response of four closely related yeast species to a variety of environmental stresses. Genes containing a TATA box in their promoters show an increased interspecies variability in expression, independent of their functional association. Examining additional data sets, we find that this enhanced expression divergence of TATA-containing genes is consistent across all eukaryotes studied to date, including nematodes, fruit flies, plants and mammals. TATA-dependent regulation may enhance the sensitivity of gene expression to genetic perturbations, thus facilitating expression divergence at particular genetic loci.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two genes, rd29A and rd29B, which are closely located on the Arabidopsis genome, are differentially induced under conditions of dehydration, low temperature, high salt, or treatment with exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). It appears that rd29A has at least two cis-acting elements, one involved in the ABA-associated response to dehydration and the other induced by changes in osmotic potential, and that rd29B contains at least one cis-acting element that is involved in ABA-responsive, slow induction. We analyzed the rd29A promoter in both transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco and identified a novel cis-acting, dehydration-responsive element (DRE) containing 9 bp, TACCGACAT, that is involved in the first rapid response of rd29A to conditions of dehydration or high salt. DRE is also involved in the induction by low temperature but does not function in the ABA-responsive, slow expression of rd29A. Nuclear proteins that specifically bind to DRE were detected in Arabidopsis plants under either high-salt or normal conditions. Different cis-acting elements seem to function in the two-step induction of rd29A and in the slow induction of rd29B under conditions of dehydration, high salt, or low temperature.},

@ARTICLE{tremousayguePlantInterstitialTelomere1999,
  ABSTRACT = {The promoters of Arabidopsis eEF1A genes contain a telomere motif, the telo-box, associated with an activating sequence, the tef-box. Database searches indicated the presence of telo-boxes in the 5{${'}$} region of numerous genes encoding components of the translational apparatus. By using several promoter constructs we demonstrate that the telo-box is required for the expression of a {$\beta$}-glucoronidase gene in root primordia of transgenic Arabidopsis. This effect was observed when a telo-box was inserted upstream or downstream from the transcription initiation site, and occurred in synergy with the tef-box. These results clearly indicate that interstitial telomere motifs in plants are involved in control of gene expression. South-western screening of a {$\lambda$}ZAP library with a double-stranded Arabidopsis telomere motif resulted in characterization of a protein related to the conserved animal protein Pur{$\alpha$}. The possibility of a regulation process similar to that achieved by the Rap1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is discussed.},

@ARTICLE{chaubetIdentificationCiselementsRegulating1996,
  ABSTRACT = {Protein—DNA interactions in the proximal region of an Arabidopsis H4 histone gene promoter were analyzed by DMS in vivo footprinting combined with LMPCR amplification. Interactions were identified over six particular sequence motifs, five of which were previously shown to bind proteins in maize histone H3 and H4 promoters and are commonly found in the corresponding regions of other plant histone gene promoters. These motifs are located within a 126 bp fragment which was previously shown to confer preferential expression in meristems of transgenic plants. The contribution of each cis-element to the overall expression level and specificity was investigated by testing individual or combined mutations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. All five motifs behaved as positive cis-elements of unequal strength. The GCCAAT-like sequence GCCACT behaved as a strong positive cis-element but had no influence on the specificity. In contrast, the nonamer AGATCGACG and to a lesser extent the closely linked hexamer CCGTCG proved to be essential for meristem-specific expression. Involvement of the highly conserved histone-specific octamer CGCGGATC in specific expression was revealed at some stages of meristem development. Importance of these three cis-elements, nonamer, hexamer, and octamer, was further confirmed by the fact that combining mutations of two of them either abolished the promoter activity or completely modified the promoter specificity. Mutation of the fifth cis-element, a degenerate copy of the octamer, little perturbed the promoter function. However disruption of both octamers had a dramatic negative effect, thus suggesting that the two copies cooperate to achieve maximal function in the wild-type promoter, possibly by mobilizing the proliferation-specific factors binding to the nonamer and CCGTCG cis-elements.},

@ARTICLE{kamiyaIsolationCharacterizationRice2003,
  ABSTRACT = {The Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) protein, which plays an important role in the specification of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), contains an `atypical' homeodomain (HD) with extra residues in its loop and turn regions. We speculated that a WUS-type atypical HD protein might also be involved in the specification and maintenance of the root apical meristem (RAM) stem cells of rice. To investigate this possibility, we isolated and characterized a rice WUS-type homeobox gene designated quiescent-center-specific homeobox (QHB) gene. Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root. During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root. However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms. We also produced transformants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS. These transformants did not form crown roots, but developed multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the WUS-type homeobox gene is involved in the specification and maintenance of the stem cells (QC cells) in the RAM, by a mechanism similar to that for WUS in the SAM.},

@ARTICLE{podderMultifunctionalityDominantlyDetermines2009,
  ABSTRACT = {Elucidation of the determinants of the rate of protein sequence evolution is one of the great challenges in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that housekeeping genes are evolutionarily slower than tissue specific genes. In the present communication, we have examined different determinants that influence the evolutionary rate variation in human housekeeping and tissue specific proteins present in protein–protein interaction network. Studies on yeast proteome, revealed a predominant role of protein connectivity in determining the rate of protein evolution. However, in human, we did not observe any significant influence of protein connectivity on its evolutionary rate. Rather, a significant impact of the proportion of protein's interacting length (amount of protein interface involved in interaction with its partners), expression level and multifunctionality has been observed in determining the rate of protein evolution. We also observed that multi interface proteins are evolutionarily conserved between housekeeping and tissue specific genes and it has been found that the average number of biological processes they associated in these two sets of genes is similar. Moreover, single interface proteins in housekeeping genes evolve more slowly as compared to tissue specific genes owing to their involvement in different number of biological processes. Partial correlation analysis suggests that the relative importance of three individual factors in determining the evolutionary rate variation between housekeeping and tissue specific proteins is in the order of protein multifunctionality{$>$}protein expression level{$>$}interacting protein length.},

@ARTICLE{biswasEvolutionaryRateHeterogeneity2018,
  ABSTRACT = {Integrating gene expression into protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) leads to the construction of tissue-specific (TS) and housekeeping (HK) sub-networks, with distinctive TS- and HK-hubs. All such hub proteins are divided into multi-interface (MI) hubs and single-interface (SI) hubs, where MI hubs evolve slower than SI hubs. Here we explored the evolutionary rate difference between MI and SI proteins within TS- and HK-PPIN and observed that this difference is present only in TS, but not in HK-class. Next, we explored whether proteins' own properties or its partners' properties are more influential in such evolutionary discrepancy. Statistical analyses revealed that this evolutionary rate correlates negatively with protein's own properties like expression level, miRNA count, conformational diversity and functional properties and with its partners' properties like protein disorder and tissue expression similarity. Moreover, partial correlation and regression analysis revealed that both proteins' and its partners' properties have independent effects on protein evolutionary rate.},

@ARTICLE{dreosInfluenceRotationalNucleosome2016,
  ABSTRACT = {The recruitment of RNA-Pol-II to the transcription start site (TSS) is an important step in gene regulation in all organisms. Core promoter elements (CPE) are conserved sequence motifs that guide Pol-II to the TSS by interacting with specific transcription factors (TFs). However, only a minority of animal promoters contains CPEs. It is still unknown how Pol-II selects the TSS in their absence. Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters' sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA-encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol-II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters' primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome-DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern. These findings support the notion that, in addition to CPEs mediated selection, sequence–induced nucleosome positioning could be a common and conserved mechanism of TSS selection in animals.},
