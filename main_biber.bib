  ABSTRACT = {Nearly a century has been spent collecting and preserving genetic diversity in plants. Germplasm banks—living seed collections that serve as repositories of genetic variation—have been established as a source of genes for improving agricultural crops. Genetic linkage maps have made it possible to study the chromosomal locations of genes for improving yield and other complex traits important to agriculture. The tools of genome research may finally unleash the genetic potential of our wild and cultivated germplasm resources for the benefit of society.},

  ABSTRACT = {Attaining global food security by means of increased crop productivity will require an increase in gains from selection achieved through conventional breeding. To this end, the identification of molecular markers associated with loci controlling traits of agronomic interest coupled with the exploitation of marker-assisted breeding (MAB) approaches provides the opportunity to accelerate gain from selection. In particular, marker-assisted selection (MAS) and marker-assisted backcrossing have been widely adopted to improve resistance to diseases and other relatively simple traits. Notwithstanding these remarkable achievements, the improvement of yield and other complex quantitative traits via MAB has been marginal, mainly due to the difficulty in identifying major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with an adequately stable effect across environments and genetic backgrounds. Additionally, the effect of most QTLs affecting yield is too small to be detected with either biparental mapping or association mapping. Genomic selection (GS) circumvents this problem by using an index for the selection of unmapped QTLs of small individual effects but with otherwise sizable effect at the whole plant level when selected together. GS is already having a positive impact on the improvement of crop yield, mainly in the private sector where high-throughput infrastructures allow breeders to handle the large number of molecular datapoints that are required for effectively deploying GS. Ultimately, an effective exploitation of MAB to enhance crop performance will rely on a closer integration between molecular approaches and conventional breeding.},

  ABSTRACT = {To improve food security, plant biology research aims to improve crop yield and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as increasing the nutrient contents of food. Conventional breeding systems have allowed breeders to produce improved varieties of many crops; for example, hybrid grain crops show dramatic improvements in yield. However, many challenges remain and emerging technologies have the potential to address many of these challenges. For example, site-specific nucleases such as TALENs and CRISPR/Cas systems, which enable high-efficiency genome engineering across eukaryotic species, have revolutionized biological research and its applications in crop plants. These nucleases have been used in diverse plant species to generate a wide variety of site-specific genome modifications through strategies that include targeted mutagenesis and editing for various agricultural biotechnology applications. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas genome-wide screens make it possible to discover novel traits, expand the range of traits, and accelerate trait development in target crops that are key for food security. Here, we discuss the development and use of various site-specific nuclease systems for different plant genome{$\lnot$}-engineering applications. We highlight the existing opportunities to harness these technologies for targeted improvement of traits to enhance crop productivity and resilience to climate change. These cutting-edge genome-editing technologies are thus poised to reshape the future of agriculture and food security.},

  ABSTRACT = {Grain yield is one of the most important and complex trait for genetic improvement in crops; it is known to be controlled by a number of genes known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In the past decade, many yield-contributing QTLs have been identified in crops. However, it remains unclear whether those QTLs confer the same yield performance in different genetic backgrounds. Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated QTL editing in five widely-cultivated rice varieties and revealed that the same QTL can have diverse, even opposing, effects on grain yield in different genetic backgrounds.},

  ABSTRACT = {Genome editing in plants has been boosted tremendously by the development of CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) technology. This powerful tool allows substantial improvement in plant traits in addition to those provided by classical breeding. Here, we demonstrate the development of virus resistance in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) using Cas9/subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) technology to disrupt the function of the recessive eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E) gene. Cas9/sgRNA constructs were targeted to the N{${'}$} and C{${'}$} termini of the eIF4E gene. Small deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in the eIF4E gene targeted sites of transformed T1 generation cucumber plants, but not in putative off-target sites. Non-transgenic heterozygous eif4e mutant plants were selected for the production of non-transgenic homozygous T3 generation plants. Homozygous T3 progeny following Cas9/sgRNA that had been targeted to both eif4e sites exhibited immunity to Cucumber vein yellowing virus (Ipomovirus) infection and resistance to the potyviruses Zucchini yellow mosaic virus and Papaya ring spot mosaic virus-W. In contrast, heterozygous mutant and non-mutant plants were highly susceptible to these viruses. For the first time, virus resistance has been developed in cucumber, non-transgenically, not visibly affecting plant development and without long-term backcrossing, via a new technology that can be expected to be applicable to a wide range of crop plants.},

  ABSTRACT = {The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD)-containing genes are plant-specific genes that play important roles in lateral organ development. In this study, we identified LBD40 (Solyc02g085910), which belongs to subfamily II of the LBD family of genes in tomato. LBD40 was highly expressed in roots and fruit. LBD40 expression was significantly induced by PEG and salt. Moreover, SlLBD40 expression was induced by methyl jasmonate treatment, while SlLBD40 expression could not be induced in the jasmonic acid-insensitive1 (jai1) mutant or MYC2-silenced plants, in which jasmonic acid (JA) signaling was disrupted. These findings demonstrate that SlLBD40 expression was dependent on JA signaling and that it might be downstream of SlMYC2, which is the master transcription factor in the JA signal transduction pathway. Overexpressing and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout transgenic tomato plants were generated to explore SlLBD40 function. The drought tolerance test showed that two SlLBD40 knockout lines wilted slightly, while SlLBD40 overexpressing plants suffered severe wilting. The statistical water loss rate and midday leaf water potential also confirmed that knockout of SlLBD40 improved the water-holding ability of tomato under drought conditions. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SlLBD40, involved in JA signaling, was a negative regulator of drought tolerance and that knockout of SlLBD40 enhanced drought tolerance in tomato. This study also provides a novel function of SlLBD40, which belongs to subfamily II of LBD genes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, control development and physiology by regulating gene expression. Mutations that affect the function of these sequences contribute to phenotypic diversity within and between species. With many case studies implicating divergent cis-regulatory activity in phenotypic evolution, researchers have recently begun to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cis-regulatory divergence. Approaches include detailed functional analysis of individual cis-regulatory elements and comparing mechanisms of gene regulation among species using the latest genomic tools. Despite the limited number of mechanistic studies published to date, this work shows how cis-regulatory activity can diverge and how studies of cis-regulatory divergence can address long-standing questions about the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {The shoot apical meristem at the growing shoot tip acts a stem cell reservoir that provides cells to generate the entire above-ground architecture of higher plants. Many agronomic plant yield traits such as tiller number, flower number, fruit number, and kernel row number are therefore defined by the activity of the shoot apical meristem and its derivatives, the floral meristems. Studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that a molecular negative feedback loop called the CLAVATA (CLV)-WUSCHEL (WUS) pathway regulates stem cell maintenance in shoot and floral meristems. CLV-WUS pathway components are associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for yield traits in crop plants such as oilseed, tomato, rice, and maize, and may have played a role in crop domestication. The conservation of these pathway components across the plant kingdom provides an opportunity to use cutting edge techniques such as genome editing to enhance yield traits in a wide variety of agricultural plant species.},

  ABSTRACT = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Major advances in crop yields are needed in the coming decades. However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse \emph{cis-}regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits \emph{trans}-generational heritability of \emph{Cas9} activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse agricultural traits, our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

@ARTICLE{lehnertReversingNitrogenFixation2018,
  ABSTRACT = {The nitrogen cycle is one of the most important biogeochemical cycles on Earth because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all life forms. To supplement natural nitrogen fixation, farmers add large amounts of nitrogen-containing fertilizer to their soils such that nitrogen never becomes a limiting nutrient for plant growth. However, of the nitrogen added to fields —{} most of which is in the form of NH3 and NO3- —{} only 30–50\% is taken up by plants, while the remainder is~metabolized by soil microorganisms in processes with detrimental environmental impacts. The~first of these processes, that is, nitrification, refers to the biological oxidation of NH3 to NO2- and NO3-, which have low retention in soil and pollute waterways, leading to downstream eutrophication and ultimately `dead zones' (low oxygen zones) in coastal waters, for example, the~Gulf of Mexico. In a second process, namely, denitrification, NO3- and NO2- undergo stepwise reduction to N2O and N2. Substantial amounts of the N2O produced in this process escape into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and ozone destruction. Recent results suggest that nitrification also affords N2O. This Review describes the enzymes involved in NH3 oxidation and N2O production and degradation in the nitrogen cycle. We pay particular attention to the active site structures, the associated coordination chemistry that enables the chemical transformations and the reaction mechanisms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are the rhizosphere bacteria that can enhance plant growth by a wide variety of mechanisms like phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, biological nitrogen fixation, rhizosphere engineering, production of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACC), quorum sensing (QS) signal interference and inhibition of biofilm formation, phytohormone production, exhibiting antifungal activity, production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), induction of systemic resistance, promoting beneficial plant-microbe symbioses, interference with pathogen toxin production etc. The potentiality of PGPR in agriculture is steadily increased as it offers an attractive way to replace the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other supplements. Growth promoting substances are likely to be produced in large quantities by these rhizosphere microorganisms that influence indirectly on the overall morphology of the plants. Recent progress in our understanding on the diversity of PGPR in the rhizosphere along with their colonization ability and mechanism of action should facilitate their application as a reliable component in the management of sustainable agricultural system. The progress to date in using the rhizosphere bacteria in a variety of applications related to agricultural improvement along with their mechanism of action with special reference to plant growth-promoting traits are summarized and discussed in this review.},

  ABSTRACT = {Denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of N oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions. The process is an essential branch of the global N cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life. Discovered more than a century ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas. Important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have been achieved with Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paracoccus denitrificans, Ralstonia eutropha, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms. Around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus. Much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established. The activation and enzymatic transformation of N oxides is based on the redox chemistry of Fe, Cu, and Mo. Biochemical breakthroughs have included the X-ray structures of the two types of respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means. This revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases. Denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme D1. An important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater FNR family. Nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct N oxide-metabolizing enzymes.},

@ARTICLE{gallowayChronologyHumanUnderstanding2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Nitrogen over the ages! It was discovered in the eighteenth century. The following century, its importance in agriculture was documented and the basic components of its cycle were elucidated. In the twentieth century, a process to provide an inexhaustible supply of reactive N (N r ; all N species except N 2 ) for agricultural, industrial and military uses was invented. This discovery and the extensive burning of fossil fuels meant that by the beginning of the twenty-first century, anthropogenic sources of newly created N r were two to three times that of natural terrestrial sources. This caused a fundamental change in the nitrogen cycle; for the first time, there was the potential for enough food to sustain growing populations and changing dietary patterns. However, most N r created by humans is lost to the environment, resulting in a cascade of negative earth systems impacts—including enhanced acid rain, smog, eutrophication, greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion, with associated impacts on human and ecosystem health. The impacts continue and will be magnified, as N r is lost to the environment at an even greater rate. Thus, the challenge for the current century is how to optimize the uses of N while minimizing the negative impacts.},

@ARTICLE{abalosPlantTraitbasedApproaches2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Intensive agriculture is dominated by monocultures of high-yielding plants that receive large applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to boost plant productivity. However, these systems have low N use efficiency (NUE) as fertilized plants generally take up less than half of the N applied. A large fraction of the remainder N is susceptible to be lost from the agroecosystem generating a cascade of environmental and socio-economic problems. Climate change and projected global increases in fertilizer use pose further risks to N losses and yield stability. We review and translate concepts from ecology in natural systems to demonstrate that NUE in intensive agroecosystems can be strongly increased by fine-tuning the traits of the plant communities to the levels of N fertilization intensity. We present key plant traits of importance for N-cycling (architectural, morphological and physiological traits, as well as symbiotic associations and exudation patterns); discuss ecological (with soil fauna and N-cycling microbial communities) and agronomic interactions of this approach; propose interdisciplinary methodologies for future research ranging from pot to global scales; and highlight possible solutions leading to an optimal balance between N fertilizer use and productivity. Synthesis and applications. By showing the strong links between plant traits and nitrogen (N) cycling, our work opens possibilities to test ecologically informed hypotheses across gradients of soil fertility and N fertilizer management intensity, setting a research agenda for the coming years. Accordingly, the choice of plant species based on their functional traits will play a central role for the development of modern and productive agroecosystems that retain and use N more efficiently.},

@ARTICLE{castromarinNitrateRegulatesFloral2011,
  ABSTRACT = {The transition from vegetative growth to reproduction is a major developmental event in plants. To maximise reproductive success, its timing is determined by complex interactions between environmental cues like the photoperiod, temperature and nutrient availability and internal genetic programs. While the photoperiod- and temperature- and gibberellic acid-signalling pathways have been subjected to extensive analysis, little is known about how nutrients regulate floral induction. This is partly because nutrient supply also has large effects on vegetative growth, making it difficult to distinguish primary and secondary influences on flowering. A growth system using glutamine supplementation was established to allow nitrate to be varied without a large effect on amino acid and protein levels, or the rate of growth. Under nitrate-limiting conditions, flowering was more rapid in neutral (12/12) or short (8/16) day conditions in C24, Col-0 and Laer. Low nitrate still accelerated flowering in late-flowering mutants impaired in the photoperiod, temperature, gibberellic acid and autonomous flowering pathways, in the fca co-2 ga1-3 triple mutant and in the ft-7 soc1-1 double mutant, showing that nitrate acts downstream of other known floral induction pathways. Several other abiotic stresses did not trigger flowering in fca co-2 ga1-3, suggesting that nitrate is not acting via general stress pathways. Low nitrate did not further accelerate flowering in long days (16/8) or in 35S::CO lines, and did override the late-flowering phenotype of 35S::FLC lines. We conclude that low nitrate induces flowering via a novel signalling pathway that acts downstream of, but interacts with, the known floral induction pathways.},

@ARTICLE{varalaTemporalTranscriptionalLogic2018,
  ABSTRACT = {Our study exploits time—the relatively unexplored fourth dimension of gene regulatory networks (GRNs)—to learn the temporal transcriptional logic underlying dynamic nitrogen (N) signaling in plants. We introduce several conceptual innovations to the analysis of time-series data in the area of predictive GRNs. Our resulting network now provides the ``transcriptional logic'' for transcription factor perturbations aimed at improving N-use efficiency, an important issue for global food production in marginal soils and for sustainable agriculture. More broadly, the combination of the time-based approaches we develop and deploy can be applied to uncover the temporal ``transcriptional logic'' for any response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.This study exploits time, the relatively unexplored fourth dimension of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), to learn the temporal transcriptional logic underlying dynamic nitrogen (N) signaling in plants. Our ``just-in-time'' analysis of time-series transcriptome data uncovered a temporal cascade of cis elements underlying dynamic N signaling. To infer transcription factor (TF)-target edges in a GRN, we applied a time-based machine learning method to 2,174 dynamic N-responsive genes. We experimentally determined a network precision cutoff, using TF-regulated genome-wide targets of three TF hubs (CRF4, SNZ, and CDF1), used to ``prune'' the network to 155 TFs and 608 targets. This network precision was reconfirmed using genome-wide TF-target regulation data for four additional TFs (TGA1, HHO5/6, and PHL1) not used in network pruning. These higher-confidence edges in the GRN were further filtered by independent TF-target binding data, used to calculate a TF ``N-specificity'' index. This refined GRN identifies the temporal relationship of known/validated regulators of N signaling (NLP7/8, TGA1/4, NAC4, HRS1, and LBD37/38/39) and 146 additional regulators. Six TFs—CRF4, SNZ, CDF1, HHO5/6, and PHL1—validated herein regulate a significant number of genes in the dynamic N response, targeting 54\% of N-uptake/assimilation pathway genes. Phenotypically, inducible overexpression of CRF4 in planta regulates genes resulting in altered biomass, root development, and 15NO3- uptake, specifically under low-N conditions. This dynamic N-signaling GRN now provides the temporal ``transcriptional logic'' for 155 candidate TFs to improve nitrogen use efficiency with potential agricultural applications. Broadly, these time-based approaches can uncover the temporal transcriptional logic for any biological response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.},

  ABSTRACT = {The cistrome is the complete set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) in an organism, while an epicistrome incorporates tissue-specific DNA chemical modifications and TF-specific chemical sensitivities into these binding profiles. Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that {$>$}75\% (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape. DAP-seq datasets also yielded insight into the biology and binding site architecture of numerous TFs, demonstrating the value of DAP-seq for cost-effective cistromic and epicistromic annotation in any organism.,},

  ABSTRACT = {High efficiency methods for DNA assembly are based on sequence overlap between fragments or Type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage and ligation. These have enabled routine assembly of synthetic DNAs of increased size and complexity. However, these techniques require customisation, elaborate vector sets and serial manipulations for the different stages of assembly. We present Loop assembly, based on a recursive approach to DNA fabrication. Alternate use of two Type IIS restriction endonucleases and corresponding vector sets allows efficient and parallel assembly of large DNA circuits. Plasmids containing standard Level 0 parts can be assembled into circuits containing 1, 4, 16 or more genes by looping between the two vector sets. The vectors also contain modular sites for hybrid assembly using sequence overlap methods. Loop assembly provides a simple generalised solution for DNA construction with standardised parts. The cloning system is provided under an OpenMTA license for unrestricted sharing and open access.},

@ARTICLE{yanaiGenomewideMidrangeTranscription2005,
  ABSTRACT = {Motivation: Genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.Results: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62\,839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index {$\tau$}, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15 \&lt; {$\tau$} \&lt; 0.85 were found to constitute \&gt;50\% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the IB tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12 - IB tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with IB = 2–11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.Availability: All data and analyses are publically available at the GeneNote website Supplementary information: Four tables available at the above site.},

  ABSTRACT = {Inventors in the field of mechanical and electronic engineering can access multitudes of components and, thanks to standardization, parts from different manufacturers can be used in combination with each other. The introduction of BioBrick standards for the assembly of characterized DNA sequences was a landmark in microbial engineering, shaping the field of synthetic biology. Here, we describe a standard for Type IIS restriction endonuclease-mediated assembly, defining a common syntax of 12 fusion sites to enable the facile assembly of eukaryotic transcriptional units. This standard has been developed and agreed by representatives and leaders of the international plant science and synthetic biology communities, including inventors, developers and adopters of Type IIS cloning methods. Our vision is of an extensive catalogue of standardized, characterized DNA parts that will accelerate plant bioengineering.},

  ABSTRACT = {CRISPOR.org is a web tool for genome editing experiments with the CRISPR–Cas9 system. It finds guide RNAs in an input sequence and ranks them according to different scores that evaluate potential off-targets in the genome of interest and predict on-target activity. The list of genomes is continuously expanded, with more 150 genomes added in the last two years. CRISPOR tries to provide a comprehensive solution from selection, cloning and expression of guide RNA as well as providing primers needed for testing guide activity and potential off-targets. Recent developments include batch design for genome-wide CRISPR and saturation screens, creating custom oligonucleotides for guide cloning and the design of next generation sequencing primers to test for off-target mutations. CRISPOR is available from http://crispor.org, including the full source code of the website and a stand-alone, command-line version.},

  ABSTRACT = {Bacterial CRISPR systems have been widely adopted to create operator-specified site-specific nucleases. Such nuclease action commonly results in loss-of-function alleles, facilitating functional analysis of genes and gene families We conducted a systematic comparison of components and T-DNA architectures for CRISPR-mediated gene editing in Arabidopsis, testing multiple promoters, terminators, sgRNA backbones and Cas9 alleles. We identified a T-DNA architecture that usually results in stable (i.e. homozygous) mutations in the first generation after transformation. Notably, the transcription of sgRNA and Cas9 in head-to-head divergent orientation usually resulted in highly active lines. Our Arabidopsis data may prove useful for optimization of CRISPR methods in other plants.},

  ABSTRACT = {Parallel DNA assembly methods allow multiple fragments of DNA to be compiled in a desired order in a single reaction. Several methods enable the efficient one-step assembly of multiple DNA parts into a suitable plasmid acceptor at high efficiency. Type IIS-mediated assembly offers the specific advantage of a one-step reaction that does not require proprietary reagents or the amplification and purification of linear DNA fragments. Instead, multiple plasmids housing standardized DNA parts of interest are combined in an enzyme cocktail. To make these standard parts, DNA sequences with defined functions are assigned specific sequence features. This allows parts to be interoperable and reusable. The availability of collections of DNA parts and molecular toolkits that allow the facile assembly of multigene binary constructs and the establishment of standards for the creation of new parts means Type IIS-mediated assembly has become a powerful technology for modern plant molecular biologists. ©{} 2016 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  ABSTRACT = {The transient gene expression system using Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts has proven an important and versatile tool for conducting cell-based experiments using molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic approaches to analyze the functions of diverse signaling pathways and cellular machineries. A well-established protocol that has been extensively tested and applied in numerous experiments is presented here. The method includes protoplast isolation, PEG–calcium transfection of plasmid DNA and protoplast culture. Physiological responses and high-throughput capability enable facile and cost-effective explorations as well as hypothesis-driven tests. The protoplast isolation and DNA transfection procedures take 6–8 h, and the results can be obtained in 2–24 h. The cell system offers reliable guidelines for further comprehensive analysis of complex regulatory mechanisms in whole-plant physiology, immunity, growth and development.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mammalian promoters can be separated into two classes, conserved TATA box–enriched promoters, which initiate at a well-defined site, and more plastic, broad and evolvable CpG-rich promoters. We have sequenced tags corresponding to several hundred thousand transcription start sites (TSSs) in the mouse and human genomes, allowing precise analysis of the sequence architecture and evolution of distinct promoter classes. Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative N termini. Among the TSSs, we identified new start sites associated with the majority of exons and with 3{${'}$} UTRs. These data permit genome-scale identification of tissue-specific promoters and analysis of the cis-acting elements associated with them.},

@ARTICLE{weiCharacterizationGenePromoters2019,
  ABSTRACT = {It is vital to understand the conservation and evolution of gene promoter sequences in order to understand environmental adaptation. The level of promoter conservation varies greatly between housekeeping (HK) and tissue-specific (TS) genes, denoting differences in the strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here, we analyzed promoter conservation and evolution to exploit differential regulation between HK and TS genes. The analysis of conserved elements showed CpG islands, short tandem repeats and G-quadruplex sequences are highly enriched in HK promoters relative to TS promoters. In addition, the type and density of regulatory motifs in TS promoters are much higher than HK promoters, indicating that TS genes show more complex regulatory patterns than HK genes. Moreover, the evolutionary dynamics of promoters showed similar evolutionary trend to coding sequences. HK promoters suffer more stringent selective pressure in the long-term evolutionary process. HK genes tend to show increased upstream sequence conservation due to stringent selection pressures acting on the promoter regions. The specificity of TS gene expression may be due to complex regulatory motifs acting in different tissues or conditions. The results from this study can be used to deepen our understanding of adaptive evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Plant genomes contain a high proportion of duplicated genes as a result of numerous whole, segmental and local duplications. These duplications lead up to the formation of gene families, which are the usual material for many evolutionary studies. However, all characterized genomes include single-copy (unique) genes that have not received much attention. Unlike gene duplication, gene loss is not an unspecific mechanism but is rather influenced by a functional selection. In this context, we have established and used stringent criteria in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present in plant proteomes. Comparisons of unique genes in the green phylum were used to characterize the gene and protein features exhibited by both conserved and species-specific unique genes.},

  ABSTRACT = {CpG islands (CGIs) are one of the most widely studied regulatory features of the human genome, with critical roles in development and disease. Despite such significance and the original epigenetic definition, currently used CGI sets are typically predicted from DNA sequence characteristics. Although CGIs are deeply implicated in practical analyses of DNA methylation, recent studies have shown that such computational annotations suffer from inaccuracies. Here we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 10 diverse human tissues to identify a comprehensive, experimentally obtained, single-base resolution CGI catalog. In addition to the unparalleled annotation precision, our method is free from potential bias due to arbitrary sequence features or probe affinity differences. In addition to clarifying substantial false positives in the widely used University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) annotations, our study identifies numerous novel epigenetic loci. In particular, we reveal significant impact of transposable elements on the epigenetic regulatory landscape of the human genome and demonstrate ubiquitous presence of transcription initiation at CGIs, including alternative promoters in gene bodies and non-coding RNAs in intergenic regions. Moreover, coordinated DNA methylation and chromatin modifications mark tissue-specific enhancers at novel CGIs. Enrichment of specific transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq supports mechanistic roles of CGIs on the regulation of tissue-specific transcription. The new CGI catalog provides a comprehensive and integrated list of genomic hotspots of epigenetic regulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding plant gene promoter architecture has long been a challenge due to the lack of relevant large-scale data sets and analysis methods. Here, we present a publicly available, large-scale transcription start site (TSS) data set in plants using a high-resolution method for analysis of 5{${'}$} ends of mRNA transcripts. Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples. Using this data set, we grouped TSS reads into ``TSS tag clusters'' and categorized clusters into three spatial initiation patterns: narrow peak, broad with peak, and weak peak. We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad ``TATA-less'' promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements. We present results on the usage of these elements and provide our Plant PEAT Peaks (3PEAT) model that predicts the presence of TSSs directly from sequence.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cytosine methylation is important for transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation of endogenous genes, although the extent to which this DNA modification functions to regulate the genome is still unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive DNA methylation map of an entire genome, at 35 base pair resolution, using the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We find that pericentromeric heterochromatin, repetitive sequences, and regions producing small interfering RNAs are heavily methylated. Unexpectedly, over one-third of expressed genes contain methylation within transcribed regions, whereas only {$\sim$}5\% of genes show methylation within promoter regions. Interestingly, genes methylated in transcribed regions are highly expressed and constitutively active, whereas promoter-methylated genes show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression. Whole-genome tiling-array transcriptional profiling of DNA methyltransferase null mutants identified hundreds of genes and intergenic noncoding RNAs with altered expression levels, many of which may be epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation.},

@ARTICLE{yamamotoHeterogeneityArabidopsisCore2009,
  ABSTRACT = {Our limited understanding of plant promoters does not allow us to recognize any core promoter elements for the majority of plant promoters. To understand the promoter architecture of Arabidopsis, we used the combined approach of in silico detection of novel core promoter elements and large-scale determination of transcription start sites (TSSs). To this end, we developed a novel methodology for TSS identification, using a combination of the cap-trapper and massively parallel signature sequencing methods. This technique, CT-MPSS, allowed us to identify 158 237 Arabidopsis TSS tags corresponding to 38 311 TSS loci, which provides an opportunity for quantitative analysis of plant promoters. The expression characteristics of these promoters were analyzed with respect to core promoter elements detected by our in silico analyses, revealing that Arabidopsis promoters contain two main types of elements with exclusive characteristics, the TATA type and the GA type. The TATA-type promoters tend to be associated with the Y Patch and the Inr motif, and cause high expression with sharp-peak TSS clusters. By contrast, the GA type produces broad-type TSS clusters. Unlike mammalian promoters, plant promoters are not associated with CpG islands. However, plant-specific GA-type promoters share some characteristics with mammalian CpG-type promoters.},

@ARTICLE{waltherRegulatoryCodeTranscriptional2007,
  ABSTRACT = {Regulation of gene expression via specific cis-regulatory promoter elements has evolved in cellular organisms as a major adaptive mechanism to respond to environmental change. Assuming a simple model of transcriptional regulation, genes that are differentially expressed in response to a large number of different external stimuli should harbor more distinct regulatory elements in their upstream regions than do genes that only respond to few environmental challenges. We tested this hypothesis in Arabidopsis thaliana using the compendium of gene expression profiling data available in AtGenExpress and known cis-element motifs mapped to upstream gene promoter regions and studied the relation of the observed breadth of differential gene expression response with several fundamental genome architectural properties. We observed highly significant positive correlations between the density of cis-elements in upstream regions and the number of conditions in which a gene was differentially regulated. The correlation was most pronounced in regions immediately upstream of the transcription start sites. Multistimuli response genes were observed to be associated with significantly longer upstream intergenic regions, retain more paralogs in the Arabidopsis genome, are shorter, have fewer introns, and are more likely to contain TATA-box motifs in their promoters. In abiotic stress time series data, multistimuli response genes were found to be overrepresented among early-responding genes. Genes involved in the regulation of transcription, stress response, and signaling processes were observed to possess the greatest regulatory capacity. Our results suggest that greater gene expression regulatory complexity appears to be encoded by an increased density of cis-regulatory elements and provide further evidence for an evolutionary adaptation of the regulatory code at the genomic layout level. Larger intergenic spaces preceding multistimuli response genes may have evolved to allow greater regulatory gene expression potential.},

@ARTICLE{sonawaneUnderstandingTissueSpecificGene2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Although all human tissues carry out common processes, tissues are distinguished by gene expression patterns, implying that distinct regulatory programs control tissue specificity. In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.},

  ABSTRACT = {The AT-rich DNA is mostly associated with condensed chromatin, whereas the GC-rich sequence is preferably located in the dispersed chromatin. The AT-rich genes are prone to be tissue-specific (silenced in most tissues), while the GC-rich genes tend to be housekeeping (expressed in many tissues). This paper reports another important property of DNA base composition, which can affect repertoire of genes with high AT content. The GC-rich sequence is more liable to mutation. We found that Spearman correlation between human gene GC content and mutation probability is above 0.9. The change of base composition even in synonymous sites affects mutation probability of nonsynonymous sites and thus of encoded proteins. There is a unique type of housekeeping genes, which are especially unsafe when prone to mutation. Natural selection which usually removes deleterious mutations, in the case of these genes only increases the hazard because it can descend to suborganismal (cellular) level. These are cell cycle-related genes. In accordance with the proposed concept, they have low GC content of synonymous sites (despite them being housekeeping). The gene-centred protein interaction enrichment analysis (PIEA) showed the core clusters of genes whose interactants are modularly enriched in genes with AT-rich synonymous codons. This interconnected network is involved in double-strand break repair, DNA integrity checkpoints and chromosome pairing at mitosis. The damage of these genes results in genome and chromosome instability leading to cancer and other `error catastrophes'. Reducing the nonsynonymous mutations, the usage of AT-rich synonymous codons can decrease probability of cancer by above 20-fold.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mapping DNase-I hypersensitive sites (HS) was used in the past to identify regulatory elements of specific genes. More recently, thousands of HS were identified in the human genome by using high-throughput methods. These approaches showed a general enrichment of HS near or within known genes, within CpG islands, within human–mouse conserved regions and in GC-rich regions of the genome. Here we show that HS: (i) are characterized by a much higher GC level (\textasciitilde 56\%) than the average GC level of the human genome (\textasciitilde 41\%); (ii) are overwhelmingly located in the GC-richest compartment of the genome, which is predominantly associated with an open chromatin structure; (iii) and are slightly more and slightly less frequent than genes, respectively, in the gene-rich and in the gene-poor isochore families.},

@ARTICLE{mattioliHighthroughputFunctionalAnalysis2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Transcription initiates at both coding and noncoding genomic elements, including mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has a different expression profile with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than nondivergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue specificity is strongly associated with having less complex transcription factor (TF) motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity. Moreover, we find that 22\% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract A fundamental question in biology is how gene expression is regulated to give rise to a phenotype. However, transcriptional variability is rarely considered although it could influence the relationship between genotype and phenotype. It is known in unicellular organisms that gene expression is often noisy rather than uniform, and this has been proposed to be beneficial when environmental conditions are unpredictable. However, little is known about inter-individual transcriptional variability in multicellular organisms. Using transcriptomic approaches, we analysed gene expression variability between individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants growing in identical conditions over a 24-h time course. We identified hundreds of genes that exhibit high inter-individual variability and found that many are involved in environmental responses, with different classes of genes variable between the day and night. We also identified factors that might facilitate gene expression variability, such as gene length, the number of transcription factors regulating the genes and the chromatin environment. These results shed new light on the impact of transcriptional variability in gene expression regulation in plants.},

@ARTICLE{theunePhylogeneticAnalysesGAGAMotif2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Plant GAGA-motif binding factors are encoded by the BARLEY B RECOMBINANT / BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BBR/BPC) family, which fulfill indispensable functions in growth and development. BBR/BPC proteins control flower development, size of the stem cell niche and seed development through transcriptional regulation of homeotic transcription factor genes. They are responsible for the context dependent recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) or other repressive proteins to GAGA-motifs, which are contained in Polycomb repressive DNA-elements (PREs). Hallmark of the protein family is the highly conserved BPC domain, which is required for DNA binding. Here we study the evolution and diversification of the BBR/BPC family and its DNA-binding domain. Our analyses supports a further division of the family into four main groups (I-IV) and several subgroups, to resolve a strict monophyletic descent of the BPC domain. We prove a polyphyletic origin for group III proteins, which evolved from group I and II members through extensive loss of domains in the N-terminus. Conserved motif searches lend to the identification of a WAKHGTN consensus and a TIR/K motif at the very C-terminus of the BPC-domain. We could show by DPI-ELISA that this signature is required for DNA-binding in AtBPC1. Additional binding studies with mutated oligonucleotides consolidated the binding to GAGA tetramers. To validate these findings, we used previously published ChIP-seq data from GFP-BPC6. We uncovered that many genes of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway are targeted by AtBPC6. Consistently, bpc6, bpc4 bpc6 and lhp1 bpc4 bpc4 mutants display brassinosteroid-dependent root growth phenotypes. Both, a function in brassinosteroid signaling and our phylogenetic data supports a link between BBR/BPC diversification in the land plant lineage and the complexity of flower and seed plant evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution. We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes. Here we present a comparison of five Drosophila genomes showing that HCNE density peaks centrally in large synteny blocks containing multiple genes. Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers, HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring genes. We describe differences in core promoters between the target genes and the unrelated genes that offer an explanation for the differences in their responsiveness to enhancers. We show examples of a striking correspondence between boundaries of synteny blocks, HCNE arrays, and Polycomb binding regions, confirming that the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes. The structural and functional equivalence between insect and vertebrate GRBs marks them as an ancient feature of metazoan genomes and as a key to future studies of development and gene regulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background Core promoters are the gene regulatory regions most proximal to the transcription start site (TSS), central to the formation of pre-initiation complexes and for combinatorial gene regulation. The DNA elements required for core promoter function in plants are poorly understood. To establish the sequence motifs that characterize plant core promoters and to compare them to the corresponding sequences in animals, we took advantage of available full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) and predicted upstream regulatory sequences to carry out the analysis of 12,749 Arabidopsis core promoters. Results Using a combination of expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling methods, we identified several motifs overrepresented in Arabidopsis core promoters. One of them corresponded to the TATA element, for which an in-depth analysis resulted in the generation of robust TATA Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFMs) capable of predicting Arabidopsis TATA elements with a high degree of confidence. We established that approximately 29\% of all Arabidopsis promoters contain TATA motifs, clustered around position -32 with respect to the TSS. The presence of TATA elements was associated with genes represented more frequently in EST collections and with shorter 5' UTRs. No cis-elements were found over-represented in TATA-less, compared to TATA-containing promoters. Conclusion Our studies provide a first genome-wide illustration of the composition and structure of core Arabidopsis promoters. The percentage of TATA-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized, yet comparable to the number of Drosophila promoters containing a TATA element. Although several other DNA elements were identified as over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters, they are present in only a small fraction of the genes and they represent elements not previously described in animals, suggesting a distinct architecture of the core promoters of plant and animal genes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Phenotypic diversity is generated through changes in gene structure or gene regulation. The availability of full genomic sequences allows for the analysis of gene sequence evolution. In contrast, little is known about the principles driving the evolution of gene expression. Here we describe the differential transcriptional response of four closely related yeast species to a variety of environmental stresses. Genes containing a TATA box in their promoters show an increased interspecies variability in expression, independent of their functional association. Examining additional data sets, we find that this enhanced expression divergence of TATA-containing genes is consistent across all eukaryotes studied to date, including nematodes, fruit flies, plants and mammals. TATA-dependent regulation may enhance the sensitivity of gene expression to genetic perturbations, thus facilitating expression divergence at particular genetic loci.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two genes, rd29A and rd29B, which are closely located on the Arabidopsis genome, are differentially induced under conditions of dehydration, low temperature, high salt, or treatment with exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). It appears that rd29A has at least two cis-acting elements, one involved in the ABA-associated response to dehydration and the other induced by changes in osmotic potential, and that rd29B contains at least one cis-acting element that is involved in ABA-responsive, slow induction. We analyzed the rd29A promoter in both transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco and identified a novel cis-acting, dehydration-responsive element (DRE) containing 9 bp, TACCGACAT, that is involved in the first rapid response of rd29A to conditions of dehydration or high salt. DRE is also involved in the induction by low temperature but does not function in the ABA-responsive, slow expression of rd29A. Nuclear proteins that specifically bind to DRE were detected in Arabidopsis plants under either high-salt or normal conditions. Different cis-acting elements seem to function in the two-step induction of rd29A and in the slow induction of rd29B under conditions of dehydration, high salt, or low temperature.},

  ABSTRACT = {The promoters of Arabidopsis eEF1A genes contain a telomere motif, the telo-box, associated with an activating sequence, the tef-box. Database searches indicated the presence of telo-boxes in the 5{${'}$} region of numerous genes encoding components of the translational apparatus. By using several promoter constructs we demonstrate that the telo-box is required for the expression of a {$\beta$}-glucoronidase gene in root primordia of transgenic Arabidopsis. This effect was observed when a telo-box was inserted upstream or downstream from the transcription initiation site, and occurred in synergy with the tef-box. These results clearly indicate that interstitial telomere motifs in plants are involved in control of gene expression. South-western screening of a {$\lambda$}ZAP library with a double-stranded Arabidopsis telomere motif resulted in characterization of a protein related to the conserved animal protein Pur{$\alpha$}. The possibility of a regulation process similar to that achieved by the Rap1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Protein—DNA interactions in the proximal region of an Arabidopsis H4 histone gene promoter were analyzed by DMS in vivo footprinting combined with LMPCR amplification. Interactions were identified over six particular sequence motifs, five of which were previously shown to bind proteins in maize histone H3 and H4 promoters and are commonly found in the corresponding regions of other plant histone gene promoters. These motifs are located within a 126 bp fragment which was previously shown to confer preferential expression in meristems of transgenic plants. The contribution of each cis-element to the overall expression level and specificity was investigated by testing individual or combined mutations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. All five motifs behaved as positive cis-elements of unequal strength. The GCCAAT-like sequence GCCACT behaved as a strong positive cis-element but had no influence on the specificity. In contrast, the nonamer AGATCGACG and to a lesser extent the closely linked hexamer CCGTCG proved to be essential for meristem-specific expression. Involvement of the highly conserved histone-specific octamer CGCGGATC in specific expression was revealed at some stages of meristem development. Importance of these three cis-elements, nonamer, hexamer, and octamer, was further confirmed by the fact that combining mutations of two of them either abolished the promoter activity or completely modified the promoter specificity. Mutation of the fifth cis-element, a degenerate copy of the octamer, little perturbed the promoter function. However disruption of both octamers had a dramatic negative effect, thus suggesting that the two copies cooperate to achieve maximal function in the wild-type promoter, possibly by mobilizing the proliferation-specific factors binding to the nonamer and CCGTCG cis-elements.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) protein, which plays an important role in the specification of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), contains an `atypical' homeodomain (HD) with extra residues in its loop and turn regions. We speculated that a WUS-type atypical HD protein might also be involved in the specification and maintenance of the root apical meristem (RAM) stem cells of rice. To investigate this possibility, we isolated and characterized a rice WUS-type homeobox gene designated quiescent-center-specific homeobox (QHB) gene. Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root. During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root. However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms. We also produced transformants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS. These transformants did not form crown roots, but developed multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the WUS-type homeobox gene is involved in the specification and maintenance of the stem cells (QC cells) in the RAM, by a mechanism similar to that for WUS in the SAM.},

  ABSTRACT = {Elucidation of the determinants of the rate of protein sequence evolution is one of the great challenges in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that housekeeping genes are evolutionarily slower than tissue specific genes. In the present communication, we have examined different determinants that influence the evolutionary rate variation in human housekeeping and tissue specific proteins present in protein–protein interaction network. Studies on yeast proteome, revealed a predominant role of protein connectivity in determining the rate of protein evolution. However, in human, we did not observe any significant influence of protein connectivity on its evolutionary rate. Rather, a significant impact of the proportion of protein's interacting length (amount of protein interface involved in interaction with its partners), expression level and multifunctionality has been observed in determining the rate of protein evolution. We also observed that multi interface proteins are evolutionarily conserved between housekeeping and tissue specific genes and it has been found that the average number of biological processes they associated in these two sets of genes is similar. Moreover, single interface proteins in housekeeping genes evolve more slowly as compared to tissue specific genes owing to their involvement in different number of biological processes. Partial correlation analysis suggests that the relative importance of three individual factors in determining the evolutionary rate variation between housekeeping and tissue specific proteins is in the order of protein multifunctionality{$>$}protein expression level{$>$}interacting protein length.},

  ABSTRACT = {Integrating gene expression into protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) leads to the construction of tissue-specific (TS) and housekeeping (HK) sub-networks, with distinctive TS- and HK-hubs. All such hub proteins are divided into multi-interface (MI) hubs and single-interface (SI) hubs, where MI hubs evolve slower than SI hubs. Here we explored the evolutionary rate difference between MI and SI proteins within TS- and HK-PPIN and observed that this difference is present only in TS, but not in HK-class. Next, we explored whether proteins' own properties or its partners' properties are more influential in such evolutionary discrepancy. Statistical analyses revealed that this evolutionary rate correlates negatively with protein's own properties like expression level, miRNA count, conformational diversity and functional properties and with its partners' properties like protein disorder and tissue expression similarity. Moreover, partial correlation and regression analysis revealed that both proteins' and its partners' properties have independent effects on protein evolutionary rate.},

@ARTICLE{dreosInfluenceRotationalNucleosome2016,
  ABSTRACT = {The recruitment of RNA-Pol-II to the transcription start site (TSS) is an important step in gene regulation in all organisms. Core promoter elements (CPE) are conserved sequence motifs that guide Pol-II to the TSS by interacting with specific transcription factors (TFs). However, only a minority of animal promoters contains CPEs. It is still unknown how Pol-II selects the TSS in their absence. Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters' sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA-encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol-II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters' primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome-DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern. These findings support the notion that, in addition to CPEs mediated selection, sequence–induced nucleosome positioning could be a common and conserved mechanism of TSS selection in animals.},

  ABSTRACT = {Promoters serve a critical role in establishing baseline transcriptional capacity through the recruitment of proteins, including transcription factors. Previously, a paucity of data for cis-regulatory elements in plants meant that it was challenging to determine which sequence elements in plant promoter sequences contributed to transcriptional function. In this study, we have identified functional elements in the promoters of plant genes and plant pathogens that utilize plant transcriptional machinery for gene expression. We have established a quantitative experimental system to investigate transcriptional function, investigating how identity, density and position contribute to regulatory function. We then identified permissive architectures for minimal synthetic plant promoters enabling the computational design of a suite of synthetic promoters of different strengths. These have been used to regulate the relative expression of output genes in simple genetic devices.},

  ABSTRACT = {The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S enhancer is able to confer strong constitutive expression in plants. We have previously defined two domains within this enhancer that can confer different tissue-specific expression patterns throughout development. We show here that the upstream domain (B) has a modular organization. It contains at least five subdomains that are able to confer distinct expression patterns when fused to the downstream domain (A). When fused to a minimal promoter only three of the five subdomains give any expression in the early stages of plant development. Comparison of the expression patterns conferred by the subdomains alone, in combination with the downstream domain or in combination with other subdomains provides evidence for synergistic interactions among cis-elements within the 35S enhancer.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined ``network motifs,'' patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

  ABSTRACT = {Little is known about the design principles1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 of transcriptional regulation networks that control gene expression in cells. Recent advances in data collection and analysis2,11,12, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks2. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli3,6. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

Just as maps of metabolic networks describe the potential pathways that may be used by a cell to accomplish metabolic processes, this network of regulator-gene interactions describes potential pathways yeast cells can use to regulate global gene expression programs.

  ABSTRACT = {Floral homeotic transcription factors (TFs) act in a combinatorial manner to specify the organ identities in the flower. However, the architecture and the~function of the gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling floral organ specification is still poorly understood. In particular, the interconnections of homeotic TFs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other factors controlling organ initiation and growth have not been studied systematically so far. Here, using a combination of genome-wide TF binding, mRNA and miRNA expression data, we reconstruct the dynamic GRN controlling floral meristem development and organ differentiation. We identify prevalent feed-forward loops (FFLs) mediated by floral homeotic TFs and miRNAs that regulate common targets. Experimental validation of a coherent FFL shows that petal size is controlled by the SEPALLATA3-regulated miR319/TCP4 module. We further show that combinatorial DNA-binding of homeotic factors and selected other TFs is predictive of organ-specific patterns of gene expression. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulatory processes underlying floral organ specification in plants.},

@ARTICLE{reevesEngineeringPrinciplesCombining2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Regulation of gene expression is of paramount importance in all living systems. In the past two decades, it has been discovered that certain motifs, such as the feedforward motif, are overrepresented in gene regulatory circuits. Feedforward loops are also ubiquitous in process control engineering, and are nearly always structured so that one branch has the opposite effect of the other, which is a structure known as an ``incoherent'' feedforward loop in biology. In engineered systems, feedforward control loops are subject to several engineering constraints, including that (1) they are finely-tuned so that the system returns to the original steady state after a disturbance occurs (perfect adaptation), (2) they are typically only implemented in the combination with negative feedback, and (3) they can greatly improve the stability and dynamical characteristics of the conjoined negative feedback loop. On the other hand, in biology, incoherent feedforward loops can serve many purposes, one of which may be perfect adaptation. It is an open question as to whether those that achieve perfect adaptation are subject to the above engineering principles.},
