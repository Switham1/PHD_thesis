  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59\% and 71\% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Variation in regulatory DNA is thought to drive evolution. Cross-species comparisons of regulatory DNA have provided evidence for both weak purifying selection and substantial turnover in regulatory regions. However, disruption of transcription factor binding sites can affect the expression of neighboring genes. Thus, the base-pair level functional annotation of regulatory DNA has proven challenging. Here, we explore regulatory DNA variation and its functional consequences in genetically diverse strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which largely maintain the positional homology of regulatory DNA. Using chromatin accessibility to delineate regulatory DNA genome-wide, we find that 15\% of approximately 50,000 regulatory sites varied in accessibility among strains. Some of these accessibility differences are associated with extensive underlying sequence variation, encompassing many deletions and dramatically hypervariable sequence. For the majority of such regulatory sites, nearby gene expression was similar, despite this large genetic variation. However, among all regulatory sites, those with both high levels of sequence variation and differential chromatin accessibility are the most likely to reside near genes with differential expression among strains. Unexpectedly, the vast majority of regulatory sites that differed in chromatin accessibility among strains show little variation in the underlying DNA sequence, implicating variation in upstream regulators.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment.

We argue that this characterization is incomplete and present a library of engineered promoters of varying strengths obtained through mutagenesis of a constitutive promoter. A multifaceted characterization of the library, especially at the single-cell level to ensure homogeneity, permitted quantitative assessment correlating the effect of gene expression levels to improved growth and product formation phenotypes in Escherichia coli. Integration of these promoters into the chromosome can allow for a quantitative accurate assessment of genetic control. To this end, we used the characterized library of promoters to assess the impact of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase levels on growth yield and deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels on lycopene production. The multifaceted characterization of promoter strength enabled identification of optimal expression levels for ppc and dxs, which maximized the desired phenotype. Additionally, in a strain preengineered to produce lycopene, the response to deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels was linear at all levels tested, indicative of a rate-limiting step, unlike the parental strain, which exhibited an optimum expression level, illustrating that optimal gene expression levels are variable and dependent on the genetic background of the strain. This promoter library concept is illustrated as being generalizable to eukaryotic organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and thus constitutes an integral platform for functional genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering endeavors.},

However, the Shh locus loops out from its chromosome territory only in the posterior limb bud (zone of polarizing activity or ZPA), where Shh expression is active. Notably, while Shh mRNA is detected throughout the ZPA, enhancer-promoter interactions and looping out were only observed in small fractions of ZPA cells. In situ detection of nascent Shh transcripts and unstable EGFP reporters revealed that active Shh transcription is likewise only seen in a small fraction of ZPA cells.

Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We applied prime editing in human cells to correct efficiently and with few byproducts the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA), to install a protective transversion in PRNP, and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing offers efficiency and product purity advantages over homology-directed repair, complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct about 89\% of known pathogenic human genetic variants.},

  abstract = {Plant genomes contain large numbers of duplicated genes that contribute to the evolution of new functions. Following duplication, genes can exhibit divergence in their coding sequence and their expression patterns. Changes in the cis-regulatory element landscape can result in changes in gene expression patterns. High-throughput methods developed recently can identify potential cis-regulatory elements on a genome-wide scale. Here, we use a recent comprehensive data set of DNase I sequencing-identified cis-regulatory binding sites (footprints) at single-base-pair resolution to compare binding sites and network connectivity in duplicated gene pairs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that duplicated gene pairs vary greatly in their cis-regulatory element architecture, resulting in changes in regulatory network connectivity. Whole-genome duplicates (WGDs) have approximately twice as many footprints in their promoters left by potential regulatory proteins than do tandem duplicates (TDs). The WGDs have a greater average number of footprint differences between paralogs than TDs. The footprints, in turn, result in more regulatory network connections between WGDs and other genes, forming denser, more complex regulatory networks than shown by TDs. When comparing regulatory connections between duplicates, WGDs had more pairs in which the two genes are either partially or fully diverged in their network connections, but fewer genes with no network connections than the TDs. There is evidence of younger TDs and WGDs having fewer unique connections compared with older duplicates. This study provides insights into cis-regulatory element evolution and network divergence in duplicated genes.},

  abstract = {The interaction of proteins with chromatin is fundamental for several essential cellular processes. During the development of an organism, genes must to be tightly regulated both temporally and spatially. This is achieved through the action of chromatin-binding proteins such as transcription factors, histone modifiers, nucleosome remodelers, and lamins. Furthermore, protein–DNA interactions are important in the adult, where their perturbation can lead to disruption of homeostasis, metabolic dysregulation, and diseases such as cancer. Understanding the nature of these interactions is of paramount importance in almost all areas of molecular biological research. In recent years, DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) has emerged as one of the most comprehensive and versatile methods available for profiling protein–DNA interactions on a genomic scale. DamID has been used to map a variety of chromatin-binding proteins in several model organisms and has the potential for continued adaptation and application in the field of genomic biology.

  abstract = {Designing the expression cassettes with desired properties remains the most important consideration of gene engineering technology. One of the challenges for predictive gene expression is the modeling of synthetic gene switches to regulate one or more target genes which would directly respond to specific chemical, environmental, and physiological stimuli. Assessment of natural promoter, high-throughput sequencing, and modern biotech inventory aided in deciphering the structure of cis elements and molding the native cis elements into desired synthetic promoter. Synthetic promoters which are molded by rearrangement of cis motifs can greatly benefit plant biotechnology applications. This review gives a glimpse of the manual in vivo gene regulation through synthetic promoters. It summarizes the integrative design strategy of synthetic promoters and enumerates five approaches for constructing synthetic promoters. Insights into the pattern of cis regulatory elements in the pursuit of desirable “gene switches” to date has also been reevaluated. Joint strategies of bioinformatics modeling and randomized biochemical synthesis are addressed in an effort to construct synthetic promoters for intricate gene regulation.},

  abstract = {The output of genetic mutant screenings in soya bean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has been limited by its paleopolypoid genome. CRISPR-Cas9 can generate multiplex mutants in crops with complex genomes. Nevertheless, the transformation efficiency of soya bean remains low and, hence, remains the major obstacle in the application of CRISPR-Cas9 as a mutant screening tool. Here, we report a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 platform to generate soya bean multiplex mutagenesis populations. We optimized the key steps in the screening protocol, including vector construction, sgRNA assessment, pooled transformation, sgRNA identification and gene editing verification. We constructed 70 CRISPR-Cas9 vectors to target 102 candidate genes and their paralogs which were subjected to pooled transformation in 16 batches. A population consisting of 407 T0 lines was obtained containing all sgRNAs at an average mutagenesis frequency of 59.2\%, including 35.6\% lines carrying multiplex mutations. The mutation frequency in the T1 progeny could be increased further despite obtaining a transgenic chimera. In this population, we characterized gmric1/gmric2 double mutants with increased nodule numbers and gmrdn1-1/1-2/1-3 triple mutant lines with decreased nodulation. Our study provides an advanced strategy for the generation of a targeted multiplex mutant population to overcome the gene redundancy problem in soya bean as well as in other major crops.},

  abstract = {In the sex pheromone communication systems of moths, both heterospecific sex pheromone components and individual conspecific pheromone components may act as behavioral antagonists when they are emitted at excessive rates and ratios. In such cases, the resulting blend composition does not comprise the sex pheromone of a given species. That is, unless these compounds are emitted at optimal rates and ratios with other compounds, they act as behavioral antagonists. Thus, the array of blend compositions that are attractive to males is centered around the characterized female-produced sex pheromone blend of a species. I suggest here that the resulting optimal attraction of males to a sex pheromone is the result of olfactory antagonistic balance, compared to the would-be olfactory antagonistic imbalance imparted by behaviorally active compounds when they are emitted individually or in other off-ratio blends. Such balanced olfactory antagonism might be produced in any number of ways in olfactory pathways, one of which would be mutual, gamma-aminobutyric-acid-related disinhibition by local interneurons in neighboring glomeruli that receive excitatory inputs from pheromone-stimulated olfactory receptor neurons. Such mutual disinhibition would facilitate greater excitatory transmission to higher centers by projection interneurons arborizing in those glomeruli. I propose that in studies of moth sex pheromone olfaction, we should no longer artificially compartmentalize the olfactory effects of heterospecific behavioral antagonists into a special category distinct from olfaction involving conspecific sex pheromone components. Indeed, continuing to impose such a delineation among these compounds may retard advances in understanding how moth olfactory systems can evolve to allow males to exhibit correct behavioral responses (that is, attraction) to novel sex-pheromone-related compositions emitted by females.},

Two and one-half days after transfection using the calcium phosphate technique we extracted RNA from the entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay. Transcripts were barely detectable when beta-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more beta-globin gene transcripts were found when the beta-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90\% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5' end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of beta-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit beta-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {High-resolution, cell type-specific analysis of gene expression greatly enhances understanding of developmental regulation and responses to environmental stimuli in any multicellular organism. In situ hybridization and reporter gene visualization can to a limited extent be used to this end but for high resolution quantitative RT-PCR or high-throughput transcriptome-wide analysis the isolation of RNA from particular cell types is requisite. Cellular dissociation of tissue expressing a fluorescent protein marker in a specific cell type and subsequent Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) makes it possible to collect sufficient amounts of material for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis/amplification and microarray analysis. An extensive set of cell type-specific fluorescent reporter lines is available to the plant research community. In this case, two marker lines of the Arabidopsis thaliana root are used: PSCR::GFP (endodermis and quiescent center) and PWOX5::GFP (quiescent center). Large numbers (thousands) of seedlings are grown hydroponically or on agar plates and harvested to obtain enough root material for further analysis. Cellular dissociation of plant material is achieved by enzymatic digestion of the cell wall. This procedure makes use of high osmolarity-induced plasmolysis and commercially available cellulases, pectinases and hemicellulases to release protoplasts into solution. FACS of GFP-positive cells makes use of the visualization of the green versus the red emission spectra of protoplasts excited by a 488 nm laser. GFP-positive protoplasts can be distinguished by their increased ratio of green to red emission. Protoplasts are typically sorted directly into RNA extraction buffer and stored for further processing at a later time. This technique is revealed to be straightforward and practicable. Furthermore, it is shown that it can be used without difficulty to isolate sufficient numbers of cells for transcriptome analysis, even for very scarce cell types (e.g. quiescent center cells). Lastly, a growth setup for Arabidopsis seedlings is demonstrated that enables uncomplicated treatment of the plants prior to cell sorting (e.g. for the cell type-specific analysis of biotic or abiotic stress responses). Potential supplementary uses for FACS of plant protoplasts are discussed.},

Previously dismissed as “junk DNA”, it is the non-coding regions of the genome that are responsible for regulation, facilitating complex temporal and spatial gene expression through the combinatorial effect of numerous mechanisms and interactions working together to fine-tune gene expression. The major regions involved in regulation of a particular gene are the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and introns. In addition, pervasive transcription of complex genomes produces a variety of non-coding transcripts that interact with these regions and contribute to regulation.

Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform non-linear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. Here, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program non-linear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and non-linear regulatory response for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune nonlinearity of network connections, dramatically expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.},

To decipher this genomic regulatory code, and to investigate the developmental relevance of noncoding transcription, we compared genome-wide promoter activity throughout embryogenesis in 5 Drosophila species. Core promoters, generally not thought to play a significant regulatory role, in fact impart restrictions on the developmental timing of gene expression on a global scale. We propose a hierarchical regulatory model in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a range of transcription factors from which they can receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including extremely widespread noncoding transcription. The sequence and expression specificity of noncoding RNA promoters are evolutionarily conserved, implying biological relevance. Overall, this work introduces a hierarchical model for developmental gene regulation, and reveals a major role for noncoding transcription in animal development.},

These include cardiovascular benefits via increased nitric oxide production, down-regulation of vasoactive peptides, lowered levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and cyclooxygenase inhibition; possible benefits on Alzheimer's disease by breakdown of beta-amyloid and direct effects on neural tissues; phytohormonal actions; anticancer properties via modulation of signal transduction, which translates into anti-initiation, antipromotion, and antiprogression effects; antimicrobial effects; and sirtuin activation, which is believed to be involved in the caloric restriction-longevity effect.

Mice homozygous for the deletion die early in embryogenesis but can be rescued with a YAC containing the human β-globin locus. After germline passage, deletion of the LCR leads to a severe reduction in expression of all mouse β-like globin genes, but no alteration in the developmental specificity of expression. Furthermore, a DNase I–sensitive “open” chromatin conformation of the locus is established and maintained. Thus, the dominant role of the LCR in the native locus is to confer high-level transcription, and elements elsewhere in the locus are sufficient to establish and maintain an open conformation and to confer developmentally regulated globin gene expression.},

Analysis of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter has contributed to the understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The intact 35S promoter confers constitutive expression upon heterologous genes in most plants. Dissection into subdomains that are able to confer tissue-specific gene expression has demonstrated that the promoter has a modular organization. When selected subdomains are combined, they confer expression not detected from the isolated subdomains, suggesting that synergistic interactions occur among cis elements. The expression patterns conferred by specific combinations of 35S subdomains differ in tobacco and petunia. This indicates that a combinatorial code of cisregulatory elements may be interpreted differently in different species.},

  abstract = {Background The private sector plays a large role in health services delivery in low- and middle-income countries; yet significant gaps remain in the quality and accessibility of private sector services. Clinical social franchising, which applies the commercial franchising model to achieve social goals and improve health care, is increasingly used in developing countries to respond to these limitations. Despite the growth of this approach, limited evidence documents the effect of social franchising on improving health care quality and access. Objectives and Methods We examined peer-reviewed and grey literature to evaluate the effect of social franchising on health care quality, equity, cost-effectiveness, and health outcomes. We included all studies of clinical social franchise programs located in low- and middle-income countries. We assessed study bias using the WHO-Johns Hopkins Rigour Scale and used narrative synthesis to evaluate the findings. Results Of 113 identified articles, 23 were included in this review; these evaluated a small sample of franchises globally and focused on reproductive health franchises. Results varied widely across outcomes and programs. Social franchising was positively associated with increased client volume and client satisfaction. The findings on health care utilization and health impact were mixed; some studies find that franchises significantly outperform other models of health care, while others show franchises are equivalent to or worse than other private or public clinics. In two areas, cost-effectiveness and equity, social franchises were generally found to have poorer outcomes. Conclusions Our review indicates that social franchising may strengthen some elements of private sector health care. However, gaps in the evidence remain. Additional research should include: further documentation of the effect of social franchising, evaluating the equity and cost-effectiveness of this intervention, and assessing the role of franchising within the context of the greater healthcare delivery system.},

  abstract = {The cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (35S) promoter has been extensively used for the constitutive expression of transgenes in dicotyledonous plants. The repetitive use of the same promoter is known to induce transgene inactivation due to promoter homology. As a way to circumvent this problem, we tested two different strategies for the development of synthetic promoters that are functionally equivalent but have a minimum sequence homology. Such promoters can be generated by (a) introducing known cis-elements in a novel or synthetic stretch of DNA or (b) “domain swapping,” wherein domains of one promoter can be replaced with functionally equivalent domains from other heterologous promoters. We evaluated the two strategies for promoter modifications using domain A (consisting of minimal promoter and subdomain A1) of the 35S promoter as a model. A set of modified 35S promoters were developed whose strength was compared with the 35S promoter per se using β-glucuronidase as the reporter gene. Analysis of the expression of the reporter gene in transient assay system showed that domain swapping led to a significant fall in promoter activity. In contrast, promoters developed by placing cis-elements in a novel DNA context showed levels of expression comparable with that of the 35S. Two promoter constructs Mod2A1T and Mod3A1T were then designed by placing the core sequences of minimal promoter and subdomain A1 in divergent DNA sequences. Transgenics developed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with the two constructs and with 35S as control were used to assess the promoter activity in different tissues of primary transformants. Mod2A1T and Mod3A1T were found to be active in all of the tissues tested, at levels comparable with that of 35S. Further, the expression of the Mod2A1T promoter in the seedlings of the T1 generation was also similar to that of the 35S promoter. The present strategy opens up the possibility of creating a set of synthetic promoters with minimum sequence homology and with expression levels comparable with the wild-type prototype by modifying sequences present between cis-elements for transgene expression in plants.},

Its main role is to transport RanGDP from cytoplasm to nucleus by interacting with FxFG nucleoporin repeats. In the study a putative new gene, designated as CcNTF2, was obtained from the moss (Conocephalum conicum) cDNA library we have constructed. The full-length cDNA sequence is 913 bp in size contains a 372 bp open reading frame (ORF) flanked by a 195 bp 5′-untranslated sequence and a long 346 bp 3′-non-coding region, encoding 123 amino acids of 13,575.3 Da. Part of the genomic sequence was also cloned and sequenced, which is 1,602 bp long and possesses two exons and one intron. Alignment analysis showed that the CcNTF2 protein is high conserved among plant NTF2 and shares 81\% similarity with the ones from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa. The expression of wild-type CcNTF2 was detected by immunoblotting of extraction of C. conicum and it indicated the putative protein is integral. Through functional expression of CcNTF2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco, it was demonstrated that CcNTF2 can accumulate at the nuclear rim. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis confirmed CcNTF2 P71K has influence on the protein import into nucleus. In addition, overexpression of CcNTF2 P71K was observed to be deleterious for the plant cell. It is the first illumination of NTF2 in moss, and our study established the primary foundation for further research on moss NTF2.},

Variability among core promoters content and distal promoter regions impedes evaluation of interactions between them during the artificial promoters construction. Synthetic promoters and artificial expression cassettes trigger a significant increase in gene expression level, better properties and quality of a product. Accumulating knowledge about gene promoters, cis sequences and their cooperating factors allows uniform expression systems and highly predictable results.},

Here we explored the evolutionary rate difference between MI and SI proteins within TS- and HK-PPIN and observed that this difference is present only in TS, but not in HK-class. Next, we explored whether proteins' own properties or its partners' properties are more influential in such evolutionary discrepancy. Statistical analyses revealed that this evolutionary rate correlates negatively with protein's own properties like expression level, miRNA count, conformational diversity and functional properties and with its partners' properties like protein disorder and tissue expression similarity. Moreover, partial correlation and regression analysis revealed that both proteins' and its partners' properties have independent effects on protein evolutionary rate.},

Deletion of leader sequences in chimeric GUS gene fusions of the spinach PetE and PsaF genes (for plastocyanin and the subunit III of photosystem I, respectively) results also in a decline in the GUS activity. Appropriate gene constructs and run-on transcription assays demonstrate unambiguously that the leaders of all three genes are involved in transcription rather than in post-transcriptional processes. They appear to contain gene-specific control elements rather than cis-determinants for general initiation factors. Expression-relevant segments in the PsaF and PetH leaders contain two CT-rich sequences, designated CT-LB and CT-B, of which at least the former binds to a protein factor in gel mobility shift assays. These motifs are not found in the PetE leader. The findings imply that leader sequences may contain cis-elements that are essential for the transcription, that they influence GUS gene expression quantitatively rather than qualitatively, and that these elements, as those of promoters, can be quite variable in sequence.},

  abstract = {Changes in chromatin accessibility are an important aspect of the molecular changes that occur in eukaryotic cells responding to stress, and they appear to play a critical role in stress-induced transcriptional activation/reprogramming and epigenetic changes. In plants, pathogen infection has been shown to induce rapid and drastic transcriptional reprogramming; growing evidence suggests that chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in this phenomenon. The recent development of genomic tools to assess chromatin accessibility presents a significant opportunity to investigate the relationship between chromatin dynamicity and gene expression. In this protocol, we have adopted a popular chromatin accessibility assay, DNase-seq, to measure chromatin accessibility in Arabidopsis infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). DNase-seq provides information on chromatin accessibility through the sequencing of DNA fragments generated by DNase I digestion of open chromatin, followed by mapping these sequences on a reference genome. Of the two popular DNase-seq approaches, we based our method on the Stamatoyannopoulos protocol, which involves two DNase cleavages rather than a single cleavage, followed by size fractionation. Please note that this two-cleavage approach is widely accepted and has been used extensively by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, a public research consortium investigating cis- and trans-elements in the transcriptional regulation in animal cells. To enhance the quality of the chromatin accessibility assay, we modified this protocol by including two centrifugation steps for nuclear enrichment and size fractionation and an extra washing step for removal of chloroplasts and Pst. The outcomes obtained by this approach are also discussed.},

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16\%–21\% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure.},

  abstract = {Recently a first genome-wide analysis of translational regulation using prokaryotic species had been performed which revealed that regulation of translational efficiency plays an important role in haloarchaea. In fact, the fractions of genes under differential growth phase-dependent translational control in the two species Halobacterium salinarum and Haloferax volcanii were as high as in eukaryotes. However, nothing is known about the mechanisms of translational regulation in archaea. Therefore, two genes exhibiting opposing directions of regulation were selected to unravel the importance of untranslated regions (UTRs) for differential translational control in vivo. Differential translational regulation in exponentially growing versus stationary phase cells was studied by comparing translational efficiencies using a reporter gene system. Translational regulation was not observed when 5′-UTRs or 3′-UTRs alone were fused to the reporter gene. However, their simultaneous presence was sufficient to transfer differential translational control from the native transcript to the reporter transcript. This was true for both directions of translational control. Translational regulation was completely abolished when stem loops in the 5′-UTR were changed by mutagenesis. An “UTR-swap” experiment demonstrated that the direction of translational regulation is encoded in the 3′-UTR, not in the 5′-UTR. While much is known about 5′-UTR-dependent translational control in bacteria, the reported findings provide the first examples that both 5′- and 3′-UTRs are essential and sufficient to drive differential translational regulation in a prokaryote and therefore have to functionally interact in vivo. The current results indicate that 3′-UTR-dependent translational control had already evolved before capping and polyadenylation of transcripts were invented, which are essential for circularization of transcripts in eukaryotes.},

The strength of expression of the promoters ranged from around 5\% to almost 100\% of the viral 35S promoter activity. We then demonstrated the utility of these promoters for metabolic engineering by transiently expressing three genes for the production of a plant diterpenoid in N.~benthamiana.

Here, we characterize the biological function of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RING-H2 protein RHA2a in ABA signaling. The rha2a mutant is less sensitive to ABA than the wild type during seed germination and early seedling development, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing RHA2a are hypersensitive, indicating that RHA2a positively regulates ABA-mediated control of seed germination and early seedling development. Double mutant analyses of rha2a with several known ABA-insensitive mutants suggest that the action of RHA2a in ABA signaling is independent of that of the transcription factors ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5. We provide evidence showing that RHA2a also positively regulates plant responses to salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination and early seedling development. RHA2a is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase, and its conserved RING domain is likely important for the biological function of RHA2a in ABA signaling. Together, these results suggest that the E3 ligase RHA2a is an important regulator of ABA signaling during seed germination and early seedling development.},

By virtue of eukaryotic DNA being complexed with histones, transcription factor binding to DNA alters or eliminates histone-DNA contacts, leading to increased accessibility of the DNA region to nuclease enzymes. This hypersensitivity to nuclease digestion has been used to define DNA binding events and regulatory elements across genomes, and to compare these attributes between cell types or conditions. These approaches make it possible to define the regulatory elements in a genome as well as to predict the regulatory networks of transcription factors and their target genes in a given cell state. As these chromatin accessibility assays are increasingly used, it is important to consider how to analyze the resulting data to avoid artifactual results or misinterpretation.

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a well-established procedure used to investigate interactions between proteins and DNA. Coupled with whole-genome DNA microarrays, ChIPs allow one to determine the entire spectrum of in vivo DNA binding sites for any given protein. The design and analysis of ChIP-microarray (also called ChIP-chip) experiments differ significantly from the conventions used for more traditional microarray experiments that measure relative transcript levels. Furthermore, fundamental differences exist between single-locus ChIP approaches and ChIP-chip experiments, and these differences require new methods of analysis. In this light, we review the design of DNA microarrays, the selection of controls, the level of repetition required, and other critical parameters for success in the design and analysis of ChIP-chip experiments, especially those conducted in the context of mammalian or other relatively large genomes.},

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation4,5,6,7,8, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)9 integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments10 de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the ‘regulome’.},

  abstract = {A number of important cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation, recombination, replication, repair, and DNA modification, are performed by DNA binding proteins. Of particular interest are transcription factors (TFs) which, through their sequence-specific interactions with DNA binding sites, modulate gene expression in a manner required for normal cellular growth and differentiation, and also for response to environmental stimuli. Despite their importance, the DNA binding specificities of most DNA binding proteins still remain unknown, since prior technologies aimed at identifying DNA–protein interactions have been laborious, not highly scalable, or have required limiting biological reagents. Recently a new DNA microarray-based technology, termed protein binding microarrays (PBMs), has been developed that allows rapid, high-throughput characterization of the in vitro DNA binding site sequence specificities of TFs, other DNA binding proteins, or synthetic compounds. DNA binding site data from PBMs combined with gene annotation data, comparative sequence analysis, and gene expression profiling, can be used to predict what genes are regulated by a given TF, what the functions are of a given TF and its predicted target genes, and how that TF may fit into the cell's transcriptional regulatory network.},

  abstract = {The majority of plants use C3 photosynthesis, but over sixty independent lineages of angiosperms have evolved the C4 pathway. In most C4 species, photosynthesis gene expression is compartmented between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. We performed DNaseI-SEQ to identify genome-wide profiles of transcription factor binding in leaves of the C4 grasses Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Setaria italica as well as C3 Brachypodium distachyon. In C4 species, while bundle sheath strands and whole leaves shared similarity in the broad regions of DNA accessible to transcription factors, the short sequences bound varied. Transcription factor binding was prevalent in gene bodies as well as promoters, and many of these sites could represent duons that impact gene regulation in addition to amino acid sequence. Although globally there was little correlation between any individual DNaseI footprint and cell-specific gene expression, within individual species transcription factor binding to the same motifs in multiple genes provided evidence for shared mechanisms governing C4 photosynthesis gene expression. Furthermore, interspecific comparisons identified a small number of highly conserved transcription factor binding sites associated with leaves from species that diverged around 60 million years ago. These data therefore provide insight into the architecture associated with C4 photosynthesis gene expression in particular and characteristics of transcription factor binding in cereal crops in general},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5′ end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5′ end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5′ end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m7Gpppm6,6AmpAmpCmpm3Um structure at the 5′ end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.},

Here, we report that uORFs correlate with significantly reduced protein expression of the downstream ORF, based on analysis of 11,649 matched mRNA and protein measurements from 4 published mammalian studies. Using reporter constructs to test 25 selected uORFs, we estimate that uORFs typically reduce protein expression by 30–80\%, with a modest impact on mRNA levels. We additionally identify polymorphisms that alter uORF presence in 509 human genes. Finally, we report that 5 uORF-altering mutations, detected within genes previously linked to human diseases, dramatically silence expression of the downstream protein. Together, our results suggest that uORFs influence the protein expression of thousands of mammalian genes and that variation in these elements can influence human phenotype and disease.},

  abstract = {Root hairs are specialized cells that are important for nutrient uptake. It is well established that nutrients such as phosphate have a great influence on root hair development in many plant species. Here we investigated the role of nitrate on root hair development at a physiological and molecular level. We showed that nitrate increases root hair density in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that two different root hair defective mutants have significantly less nitrate than wild-type plants, suggesting that in A. thaliana root hairs have an important role in the capacity to acquire nitrate. Nitrate reductase-null mutants exhibited nitrate-dependent root hair phenotypes comparable with wild-type plants, indicating that nitrate is the signal that leads to increased formation of root hairs. We examined the role of two key regulators of root hair cell fate, CPC and WER, in response to nitrate treatments. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants showed that CPC is essential for nitrate-induced responses of root hair development. Moreover, we showed that NRT1.1 and TGA1/TGA4 are required for pathways that induce root hair development by suppression of longitudinal elongation of trichoblast cells in response to nitrate treatments. Our results prompted a model where nitrate signaling via TGA1/TGA4 directly regulates the CPC root hair cell fate specification gene to increase formation of root hairs in A. thaliana.},

Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative N termini.

  abstract = {Communication between distal chromosomal elements is essential for control of many nuclear processes. For example, genes in higher eukaryotes often require distant enhancer sequences for high-level expression. The mechanisms proposed for long-range enhancer action fall into two basic categories. Non-contact models propose that enhancers act at a distance to create a favorable environment for gene transcription1,2,3, or act as entry sites4 or nucleation points5 for factors that ultimately communicate with the gene. Contact models propose that communication occurs through direct interaction between the distant enhancer and the gene by various mechanisms that 'loop out' the intervening sequences6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Although much attention has focused on contact models, the existence and nature of long-range interactions is still controversial and speculative, as there is no direct evidence that distant sequences physically interact in vivo14. Here, we report the development of a widely applicable in situ technique to tag and recover chromatin in the immediate vicinity of an actively transcribed gene. We show that the classical enhancer element, HS2 of the prototypical locus control region (LCR) of the β-globin gene cluster, is in close physical proximity to an actively transcribed HBB (β-globin) gene located over 50 kb away in vivo, suggesting a direct regulatory interaction. The results give unprecedented insight into the in vivo structure of the LCR–gene interface and provide the first direct evidence of long-range enhancer communication.},

Developmental GRNs interpret maternally deposited molecules and externally supplied signals to direct cell-fate decisions, which ultimately leads to the arrangements of organs and tissues in the organism. Genetically encoded modifications to these networks have generated the wide range of metazoan diversity that exists today. Most studies of GRN evolution focus on changes to cis-regulatory DNA, and it was historically theorized that changes to the transcription factors that bind to these cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) contribute to this process only rarely. A growing body of evidence suggests that changes to the coding regions of transcription factors play a much larger role in the evolution of developmental gene regulatory networks than originally imagined. Just as cis-regulatory changes make use of modular binding site composition and tissue-specific modules to avoid pleiotropy, transcription factor coding regions also predominantly evolve in ways that limit the context of functional effects. Here, we review the recent works that have led to this unexpected change in the field of Evolution and Development (Evo-Devo) and consider the implications these studies have had on our understanding of the evolution of developmental processes.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in a variety of cellular processes through regulation of their target gene expression. Accumulated experimental evidence has demonstrated that infections by viruses are associated with the altered expression profile of miRNAs and their mRNA targets in the host. However, the regulatory network of miRNA-mRNA interactions during viral infection remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed small RNA (sRNA)-seq, degradome-seq and as well as a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to profile the global gene and miRNA expression in soybean following infections by three different Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) isolates, L (G2 strain), LRB (G2 strain) and G7 (G7 strain). sRNA-seq analyses revealed a total of 253 soybean miRNAs with a two-fold or greater change in abundance compared with the mock-inoculated control. 125 transcripts were identified as the potential cleavage targets of 105 miRNAs and validated by degradome-seq analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed that total 2679 genes are differentially expressed in response to SMV infection including 71 genes predicted as involved in defense response. Finally, complex miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were derived using the RNAseq, small RNAseq and degradome data. This work represents a comprehensive, global approach to examining virus-host interactions. Genes responsive to SMV infection are identified as are their potential miRNA regulators. Additionally, regulatory changes of the miRNAs themselves are described and the regulatory relationships were supported with degradome data. Taken together these data provide new insights into molecular SMV-soybean interactions and offer candidate miRNAs and their targets for further elucidation of the SMV infection process.},

Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups as follows: control group, stress group, and three stress groups with low, medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation respectively. The changes of cognitive performances were examined by open-field test, water maze and step-through test. Results demonstrated that serum levels of cortisol were all increased obviously in four stress groups. The cognitive performances of stress group were changed evidently. And these changes were improved in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups. In addition, plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-2 were increased in four stress groups, serum norepinephrine and dopamine were decreased dramatically in stress group and stress low-dose GTPs modulation group. The serum norepinephrine and dopamine levels in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups were increased in contrast to that of stress group. Furthermore, the changes of anti-oxidative capacity in brain tissue were also measured. Except superoxide dismutase, the changes of malondialdehyde, reactive oxidative species and total anti-oxidative capacity of stress group were significantly different from that of control group. These changes in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups were improved. Our results suggested that psychological stress impaired body's cognitive performances, and moderate GTPs modulation could improve these abnormal changes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the improving effects of GTPs on cognitive dysfunctions induced by psychological stress.},

A comparative analysis of expression profiles of SPS was carried out in association with sucrose metabolism patterns during fruit ripening in three banana cultivars, Cavendish (AAA), Kanthali (AB) and Monthan (AAB). Analysis of the transcript and protein accumulation patterns of the SPS gene during ripening revealed differential timing in expression of the gene which correlated well with variation in sucrose metabolism patterns in the three cultivars. The expression levels of SPS increased considerably during early ripening in Cavendish after exogenous application of ethylene, while in Kanthali ethylene treatment only moderately increased SPS expression during postharvest ripening. In Monthan, expression of SPS was very low throughout ripening and ethylene treatment did not stimulate the expression of the gene in this cultivar. Analysis of a promoter fragment of SPS in the three cultivars revealed a putative reverse GCC-box ERE motif. DNA–protein interaction studies demonstrated the role of this regulatory element in differential transcriptional regulation of SPS. Overall our results provide information about sucrose metabolism patterns at the physiological and molecular levels during fruit ripening in three natural banana cultivars.},

To explore regulatory landscapes, genomic locations of TFBSs have been captured from 662 public ChIP-seq samples using standard data processing. A total of 1 233~999 regulatory linkages were identified from 99 regulatory factors (TFs, histones and other DNA-binding proteins) and their target genes across seven species. Additionally, this new version added 2449 matrices extracted from ChIP-seq peaks for cis-regulatory element prediction. In addition to integrated ChIP-seq data, four major improvements were provided for more comprehensive information of TF binding events, including (i) 1107 experimentally verified TF matrices from the literature, (ii) gene regulation network comparison between two species, (iii) 3D structures of TFs and TF-DNA complexes and (iv) condition-specific co-expression networks of TFs and their target genes extended to four species. The PlantPAN 3.0 can not only be efficiently used to investigate critical cis- and trans-regulatory elements in plant promoters, but also to reconstruct high-confidence relationships among TF-targets under specific conditions.},

The presence of polysaccharides in a DNA preparation can inhibit use of techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is a surfactant useful for isolation of DNA from tissues containing high amounts of polysaccharides. Under the high-salt conditions used in this protocol, the CTAB binds the polysaccharides, removing them from the solution. When used with Arabidopsis, this procedure yields quite pure DNA that is suitable for thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR).},

Arrays of nucleosomes usually exist as condensed chromatin fibers with a nucleosome repeat length of about 200 bp. The DNA within condensed chromatin is for the most part relatively inaccessible to proteins, such as nucleases. However, about 1\% of the genome exists as discrete regions of decondensed chromatin termed DNaseI hypersensitive (DH) sites (1) which provide greatly increased access to factors that interact with DNA. DH sites represent local perturbations of the nucleosome array and probably arise via the reorganization of single nucleosomes within the chromatin fiber. Wherease DH sites exist as open regions of chromatin in nuclei, they are not typically hypersensitive to DNaseI within protein-free DNA.},

Here, we perform high resolution mapping of CEBP proteins to determine how sequence dictates genomic occupancy. We demonstrate a fundamental difference between the sequence repertoire utilized by CEBPs in vivo versus the palindromic sequence preference reported by classical in vitro models, by identifying a palindromic motif at {$<$}1\% of the genomic binding sites. On the native genome, CEBPs bind a diversity of related 10 bp sequences resulting from the fusion of degenerate and canonical half-sites. Altered DNA specificity of CEBPs in cells occurs through heterodimerization with other bZip TFs, and approximately 40\% of CEBP-binding sites in primary human cells harbor motifs characteristic of CEBP heterodimers. In addition, we uncover an important role for sequence bias at core-motif-flanking bases for CEBPs and demonstrate that flanking bases regulate motif function across mammalian bZip TFs. Favorable flanking bases confer efficient TF occupancy and transcriptional activity, and DNA shape may explain how the flanks alter TF binding. Importantly, motif optimization within the 10-mer is strongly correlated with cell-type-independent recruitment of CEBP beta, providing key insight into how sequence sub-optimization affects genomic occupancy of widely expressed CEBPs across cell types.},

  abstract = {The most well-studied function of DNA methylation in eukaryotic cells is the transcriptional silencing of genes and transposons. More recent results showed that many eukaryotes methylate the bodies of genes as well and that this methylation correlates with transcriptional activity rather than repression. The purpose of gene body methylation remains mysterious, but is potentially related to the histone variant H2A.Z. Studies in plants and animals have shown that the genome-wide distributions of H2A.Z and DNA methylation are strikingly anticorrelated. Furthermore, we and other investigators have shown that this relationship is likely to be the result of an ancient but unknown mechanism by which DNA methylation prevents the incorporation of H2A.Z. Recently, we discovered strong correlations between the presence of H2A.Z within gene bodies, the degree to which a gene's expression varies across tissue types or environmental conditions, and transcriptional misregulation in an h2a.z mutant. We propose that one basal function of gene body methylation is the establishment of constitutive expression patterns within housekeeping genes by excluding H2A.Z from their bodies.},

We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on ∼30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3′ cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter.

  abstract = {Disruptions in chromatin structure are necessary for the regulation of eukaryotic genomes, from remodelling of nucleosomes at the base pair level through to large-scale chromatin domains that are hundreds of kilobases in size. RNA polymerase is a powerful motor which, prevented from turning with the tight helical pitch of the DNA, generates over-wound DNA ahead of itself and under-wound DNA behind. Mounting evidence supports a central role for transcription-dependent DNA supercoiling in disrupting chromatin structure at all scales. This supercoiling changes the properties of the DNA helix in a manner that substantially alters the binding specificity of DNA binding proteins and complexes, including nucleosomes, polymerases, topoisomerases and transcription factors. For example, transient over-wound DNA destabilises nucleosome core particles ahead of a transcribing polymerase, whereas under-wound DNA facilitates pre-initiation complex formation, transcription factor binding and nucleosome core particle association behind the transcribing polymerase. Importantly, DNA supercoiling can also dissipate through DNA, even in a chromatinised context, to influence both local elements and large chromatin domains. We propose a model in which changes in unconstrained DNA supercoiling influences higher levels of chromatin organisation through the additive effects of DNA supercoiling on both DNA-protein and DNA-nucleosome interactions. This model links small-scale changes in DNA and chromatin to the higher-order fibre and large-scale chromatin structures, providing a mechanism relating gene regulation to chromatin architecture in vivo.},

  abstract = {Promoters control the expression of genes in response to one or more transcription factors (TFs). The architecture of a promoter is the arrangement and type of binding sites within it. To understand natural genetic circuits and to design promoters for synthetic biology, it is essential to understand the relationship between promoter function and architecture. We constructed a combinatorial library of random promoter architectures. We characterized 288 promoters in Escherichia coli, each containing up to three inputs from four different TFs. The library design allowed for multiple −10 and −35 boxes, and we observed varied promoter strength over five decades. To further analyze the functional repertoire, we defined a representation of promoter function in terms of regulatory range, logic type, and symmetry. Using these results, we identified heuristic rules for programming gene expression with combinatorial promoters.},

Here we describe DNase-chip, an approach that can rapidly identify DNase I hypersensitive sites for any region of interest, or potentially for the entire genome, by using tiled microarrays. We used DNase-chip to identify DNase I hypersensitive sites accurately from a representative 1\% of the human genome in both primary and immortalized cell types. We found that although most DNase I hypersensitive sites were present in both cell types studied, some of them were cell-type specific. This method can be applied globally or in a targeted fashion to any tissue from any species with a sequenced genome.},

  abstract = {A major goal in genomics is to understand how genes are regulated in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis, using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000 tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified 14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites. Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes, CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and HeLa cells. However, ∼10\% of the DNase HS sites are lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates cell function and fate.},

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has traditionally represented the gold-standard experimental method for identifying regulatory elements, but the labor-intensive nature of this technique has limited its application to only a small number of human genes. We have developed a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of gene regulatory sequences by cloning DNase HS sites. We generated a library of DNase HS sites from quiescent primary human CD4+ T cells and analyzed ≈5,600 of the resulting clones. Compared to sequences from randomly generated in silico libraries, sequences from these clones were found to map more frequently to regions of the genome known to contain regulatory elements, such as regions upstream of genes, within CpG islands, and in sequences that align between mouse and human. These cloned sites also tend to map near genes that have detectable transcripts in CD4+ T cells, demonstrating that transcriptionally active regions of the genome are being selected. Validation of putative regulatory elements was achieved by repeated recovery of the same sequence and real-time PCR. This cloning strategy, which can be scaled up and applied to any cell line or tissue, will be useful in identifying regulatory elements controlling global expression differences that delineate tissue types, stages of development, and disease susceptibility.},

We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5′ UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on protein expression of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the protein expression of both a held-out set of the random 5′ UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5′ UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly active 5′ UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences led to higher protein expression rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.},

Initially, we use our approach to reprogram native promoters for increased expression and evaluate their performance in various genetic contexts. Increases in expression ranging from 1.5- to nearly 6-fold in a plasmid-based system and up to 16-fold in a genomic context were obtained. Next, we demonstrate that, in a single design cycle, it is possible to create functional, purely synthetic yeast promoters that achieve substantial expression levels (within the top sixth percentile among native yeast promoters). In doing so, this work establishes a unique DNA-level specification of promoter activity and demonstrates predictive design of synthetic parts.},

Identifying the chromatin state of any single cell, which may or may not have a different function or represent different stages relative to others collected within any single culture, experiment, or tissue, has been challenging. Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of over 15,000 single cells.
Science, this issue p. 910
Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.

It is important to know the genomic targets of DNA-binding proteins and the mechanisms by which they control and guide gene regulation pathways and cellular proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an important technique in the study of protein-gene interactions. Using ChIP, DNA-protein interactions are studied within the context of the cell. The basic steps in this technique are fixation, sonication, immunoprecipitation, and analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA. Although ChIP is a very versatile tool, the procedure requires the optimization of reaction conditions. Several modifications to the original ChIP technique have been published to improve the success and to enhance the utility of this procedure. This review addresses the critical parameters and the variants of ChIP as well as the different analytical tools that can be combined with ChIP to enable better understanding of DNA-protein interactions in vivo.},

Whether chromatin accessibility can be assessed in complex, dynamic systems in vivo with high sensitivity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use ATAC-seq to identify chromatin accessibility changes in a whole animal, the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, from embryogenesis to adulthood. Chromatin accessibility changes between developmental stages are highly reproducible, recapitulate histone modification changes, and reveal key regulatory aspects of the epigenomic landscape throughout organismal development. We find that over 5000 distal noncoding regions exhibit dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility between developmental stages and could thereby represent putative enhancers. When tested in vivo, several of these putative enhancers indeed drive novel cell-type- and temporal-specific patterns of expression. Finally, by integrating transcription factor binding motifs in a machine learning framework, we identify EOR-1 as a unique transcription factor that may regulate chromatin dynamics during development. Our study provides a unique resource for C. elegans, a system in which the prevalence and importance of enhancers remains poorly characterized, and demonstrates the power of using whole organism chromatin accessibility to identify novel regulatory regions in complex systems.},

  abstract = {Detailed functional analyses of many fundamentally important plant genes via conventional loss-of-function approaches are impeded by the severe pleiotropic phenotypes resulting from these losses. In particular, mutations in genes that are required for basic cellular functions and/or reproduction often interfere with the generation of homozygous mutant plants, precluding further functional studies. To overcome this limitation, we devised a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based tissue-specific knockout system, CRISPR-TSKO, enabling the generation of somatic mutations in particular plant cell types, tissues, and organs. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CRISPR-TSKO mutations in essential genes caused well-defined, localized phenotypes in the root cap, stomatal lineage, or entire lateral roots. The modular cloning system developed in this study allows for the efficient selection, identification, and functional analysis of mutant lines directly in the first transgenic generation. The efficacy of CRISPR-TSKO opens avenues for discovering and analyzing gene functions in the spatial and temporal contexts of plant life while avoiding the pleiotropic effects of system-wide losses of gene function.},

For example, based on studies on hemoglobinopathies, it was understood that gene expression can be under the control of DNA elements that locate away from the genes on the linear chromosome template. Recent technological developments have allowed the demonstration that these regulatory DNA elements communicate with the genes through physical interaction, which loops out the intervening chromatin fiber. Subsequent studies showed that the spatial organization of the β‐globin locus dynamically changes in relation to differences in gene expression. Moreover, it was shown that the β‐globin locus adopts a different position in the nucleus during development and erythroid maturation. Here, we discuss the most recent insight into the three‐dimensional organization of gene expression.},

It is thought that gene duplication helps cells maintain genetic robustness, but this seems not to be the whole story. Diss et al. investigated the fate of protein-protein interactions among duplicated genes in yeast. Some interacting duplicates evolved mutual dependence, resulting in a more fragile system. This finding helps us understand the evolutionary trajectories of gene duplications and how seemingly redundant genes can increase the complexity of protein interaction networks.
Science, this issue p. 630
The maintenance of duplicated genes is thought to protect cells from genetic perturbations, but the molecular basis of this robustness is largely unknown. By measuring the interaction of yeast proteins with their partners in wild-type cells and in cells lacking a paralog, we found that 22 out of 56 paralog pairs compensate for the lost interactions. An equivalent number of pairs exhibit the opposite behavior and require each other’s presence for maintaining their interactions. These dependent paralogs generally interact physically, regulate each other’s abundance, and derive from ancestral self-interacting proteins. This reveals that gene duplication may actually increase mutational fragility instead of robustness in a large number of cases.
Yeast gene duplicates illuminate the evolution of the protein-protein interaction network.

  abstract = {Robustness is the ability of a system to maintain its function despite environmental or genetic perturbation. Genetic robustness is a key emerging property of living systems and is achieved notably by the presence of partially redundant parts that result from gene duplication. Functional overlap between paralogs allows them to compensate for each other's loss, as commonly revealed by aggravating genetic interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the genotype (loss of function of a gene) to the phenotype (genetic buffering by a paralog) are still poorly understood and the molecular aspects of this compensation are rarely addressed in studies of gene duplicates. Here, we review molecular mechanisms of functional compensation between paralogous genes, many of which from studies that were not meant to study this phenomenon. We propose a standardized terminology and, depending on whether or not the molecular behavior of the intact gene is modified in response to the deletion of its paralog, we classify mechanisms of compensation into passive and active events. We further describe three non-exclusive mechanisms of active paralogous compensation for which there is evidence in the literature: changes in abundance, in localization, and in protein interactions. This review will serve as a framework for the genetic and molecular analysis of paralogous compensation, one of the universal features of genetic systems. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

To demonstrate the accuracy of this approach, we analyzed ∼300 kilobases of human genome sequence from diverse gene loci and cleanly delineated functional elements corresponding to a spectrum of classical cis-regulatory activities including enhancers, promoters, locus control regions and insulators as well as novel elements. Systematic, high-throughput identification of functional elements coinciding with DNase I hypersensitive sites will substantially expand our knowledge of transcriptional regulation and should simplify the search for noncoding genetic variation with phenotypic consequences.},

We further show that GFP, Cas9, and gRNA introduced into wheat via foliar application (spraying on) of plasmid coated carbon dots are expressed and, in the case of Cas9, make genome edits in SPO11 genes. Therefore, we present a protocol for spray-on gene editing that is simple, inexpensive, fast, transforms in planta, and is applicable to multiple crop species.

Core promoter elements (CPE) are conserved sequence motifs that guide Pol-II to the TSS by interacting with specific transcription factors (TFs). However, only a minority of animal promoters contains CPEs. It is still unknown how Pol-II selects the TSS in their absence. Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters’ sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA-encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol-II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters’ primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome-DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern. These findings support the notion that, in addition to CPEs mediated selection, sequence–induced nucleosome positioning could be a common and conserved mechanism of TSS selection in animals.},

The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

Sequence analysis demonstrated that the Mo17 zmzf promoter contained multiple cis-regulatory elements responding to anaerobic conditions. These included two GC-motifs, five anaerobic response elements (AREs), one GT-motif, and four G-boxes. Sequence alignment revealed that there was a 195 bp DNA deletion (−258 to −452 bp) in the Hz32 zmzf promoter compared with the Mo17 promoter. The deleted fragment contained three AREs. According to quantitative real time PCR analysis, the expression of the uidA gene driven by the Mo17 zmzf promoter increased after day 1 waterlogging treatment, peaked after day 2 and decreased at days 4–8. Staining for β-glucuronidase (GUS) was observed in the roots of Mo17 zmzf transgenic lines under waterlogged conditions, but not in the leaves. GUS expression was not observed in the roots and leaves of Hz32 zmzf transgenic lines, even under submerged conditions, indicating that the Hz32 zmzf promoter was non-functional because of the deletion of three AREs. We propose that the Mo17 zmzf promoter was inducible by waterlogging, highly active, and root-specific, and might be useful for the genetic engineering of waterlogging tolerance.},

  abstract = {The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of mRNAs contains elements that affect expression, yet the rules by which these regions exert their effect are poorly understood. Here, we studied the impact of 5′-UTR sequences on protein levels in yeast, by constructing a large-scale library of mutants that differ only in the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a fluorescent reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for over 2,000 unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned an approximately sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating the powerful consequences of sequence manipulations of even 1-10 nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon. We devised computational models that predicted over 70\% of the measured expression variability in held-out sequence variants. Notably, a combined model of the most prominent features successfully explained protein abundance in an additional, independently constructed library, whose nucleotide composition differed greatly from the library used to parameterize the model. Our analysis reveals the dominant contribution of the start codon context at positions −3 to −1, mRNA secondary structure, and out-of-frame upstream AUGs (uAUGs) to phenotypic diversity, thereby advancing our understanding of how protein levels are modulated by 5′-UTR sequences, and paving the way toward predictably tuning protein expression through manipulations of 5′-UTRs.},

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed1,2 to produce thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)3,4. A few of these lncRNAs have been shown to recruit regulatory complexes through RNA–protein interactions to influence the expression of nearby genes5,6,7, and it has been suggested that many other lncRNAs can also act as local regulators8,9. Such local functions could explain the observation that lncRNA expression is often correlated with the expression of nearby genes2,10,11. However, these correlations have been challenging to dissect12 and could alternatively result from processes that are not mediated by the lncRNA transcripts themselves. For example, some gene promoters have been proposed to have dual functions as enhancers13,14,15,16, and the process of transcription itself may contribute to gene regulation by recruiting activating factors or remodelling nucleosomes10,17,18. Here we use genetic manipulation in mouse cell lines to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and find that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighbouring gene in cis. Notably, none of these effects requires the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involves general processes associated with their production, including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript. Furthermore, such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we find that four out of six protein-coding loci also influence the expression of a neighbour. These results demonstrate that cross-talk among neighbouring genes is a prevalent phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis-regulatory signals, including a role for RNA splice sites. These mechanisms may explain the function and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and broadly contribute to the regulation of both coding and non-coding genes.},

  abstract = {Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution. We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes. Here we present a comparison of five Drosophila genomes showing that HCNE density peaks centrally in large synteny blocks containing multiple genes. Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers, HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring genes. We describe differences in core promoters between the target genes and the unrelated genes that offer an explanation for the differences in their responsiveness to enhancers. We show examples of a striking correspondence between boundaries of synteny blocks, HCNE arrays, and Polycomb binding regions, confirming that the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes. The structural and functional equivalence between insect and vertebrate GRBs marks them as an ancient feature of metazoan genomes and as a key to future studies of development and gene regulation.},

To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities ("suboptimization"). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain "superenhancers," circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity.},

Despite the discovery of the first enhancer more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the importance of "syntax" (the order, orientation, and spacing of binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a "regulatory code" of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra), a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.},

Chromosomes form 3D structures that are critical to~the regulation of cellular and genetic processes. Here, we present a study of global chromatin interaction patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our genome-wide approach confirmed interactions that were previously observed by other methods as well as uncovered long-range interactions such as those among small heterochromatic regions embedded in euchromatic arms. We also found that interactions are correlated with various epigenetic marks that are localized in active or silenced chromatin. Arabidopsis chromosomes do not contain large local interactive domains that resemble the topological domains described in animals but, instead, contain relatively small interactive regions scattered around the genome that contain H3K27me3 or H3K9me2. We generated interaction maps in mutants that are defective in specific epigenetic pathways and found altered interaction patterns~that correlate with changes in the epigenome. These analyses provide further insights into molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of the genome.},

  abstract = {In our previous study, c-fos chromatin accessibility was assayed using DNase I digestion and Southern blot analysis. This low-resolution mapping of c-fos chromatin accessibility demonstrated that serum stimulation of the c-fos enhancer induces a reversivle increase in c-fos DNase I sensitivity and suggested that a 5′ to 3′ gradient of DNase I sensitivity may form downstream from the c-fos enhancer. To confirm the existence of a 5′ to 3′ gradient of accessibility, we have recently developed a high-resolution polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for DNase I sensitivity. Using this novel DNase I assay, we have reliably detected position- and time-dependent gradients of chromatin accessibility around the c-fos enhancer. These data confirm our earlier results and further support the hypothesis that the changes in c-fos chromatin accessibility originate near the 5′ enhancer. As a technique for future examinations of gene structure, our data demonstrate the value of the DNase I-PCR assay for rapidly preparing comprehensive and high-resolution maps of chromatin accessibility for any sequenced genomic region.},

  abstract = {The highly nutritional and ecofriendly Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) has hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, and antihypertensive properties. Spirulina contains functional compounds, such as phenolics, phycocyanins, and polysaccharides, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulating effects. Studies conducted on Spirulina suggest that it is safe in healthy subjects, but attitude to eating probably affects the acceptability of Spirulina containing foods. Although the antioxidant effect of Spirulina is confirmed by the intervention studies, the concerted modulation of antioxidant and inflammatory responses, suggested by in vitro and animal studies, requires more confirmation in humans. Spirulina supplements seem to affect more effectively the innate immunity, promoting the activity of natural killer cells. The effects on cytokines and on lymphocytes’ proliferation depend on age, gender, and body weight differences. In this context, ageing and obesity are both associated with chronic low grade inflammation, immune impairment, and intestinal dysbiosis. Microbial-modulating activities have been reported in vitro, suggesting that the association of Spirulina and probiotics could represent a new strategy to improve the growth of beneficial intestinal microbiota. Although Spirulina might represent a functional food with potential beneficial effects on human health, the human interventions used only supplements. Therefore, the effect of food containing Spirulina should be evaluated in the future.},

Hypersensitivity of cis-regulatory elements to digestion with DNaseI remains the gold-standard approach to locating such elements. Traditional methods used to identify DNaseI hypersensitive sites are cumbersome and can only be applied to short stretches of DNA at defined locations. Here we report the development of a novel genomic array-based approach to DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping (ADHM) that permits precise, large-scale identification of such sites from as few as 5 million cells. Using ADHM we identified all previously recognized hematopoietic regulatory elements across 200 kb of the mouse T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (Tal1) locus, and, in addition, identified two novel elements within the locus, which show transcriptional regulatory activity. We further validated the ADHM protocol by mapping the DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 250 kb of the human TAL1 locus in CD34+ primary stem/progenitor cells and K562 cells and by mapping the previously known DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 240 kb of the human α-globin locus in K562 cells. ADHM provides a powerful approach to identifying DNaseI hypersensitive sites across large genomic regions.},

  abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.
For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation.
Sidow (1996, p. 717)
On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene.
Walsh (1995, p. 426)
Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely.
Nadeau and Sankoff (1997, p. 1259)
Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

This review focuses on supplements which have anxiolytic or mild relaxation properties and enhance mood. For example, Kava (Piper methysticum) is reported to have anaxiolytic actions and to reduce tension through skeletal muscle relaxation. Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.},

Regrettably, the stratum corneum forms a formidable barrier that hinders the percutaneous penetration of most drugs, offering an important protection mechanism to the organism against entrance of possible dangerous exogenous molecules. Different types of penetration enhancers have shown the potential to reversibly overcome this barrier to provide effective delivery of drugs across the skin. Although certain chemical and physical skin penetration enhancers are already employed by the pharmaceutical industry in commercially available transdermal products, some skin penetration enhancers are associated with irritating and toxic effects. This emphasizes the need for the discovery of new, safe and effective skin penetration enhancers. Penetration enhancers from natural origin have become popular as they offer several benefits over their synthetic counterparts such as sustainable mass production from a renewable resource and lower cost depending on the type of extraction used. The aim of this article is to give a comprehensive summary of the results from scientific research conducted on skin penetration enhancers of natural origin. The discussions on these natural penetration enhancers have been organized into the following chemical classes: essential oils, terpenes, fatty acids and polysaccharides.},

In contrast to the genetic code, the transcriptional regulatory code is far from being deciphered and is determined by sequence specificity of TFs, combinatorial cooperation between TFs and chromatin competence. Here we addressed one of these determinants by characterizing the target sequence specificity of 63 plant TFs representing 25 families, using protein-binding microarrays. Remarkably, almost half of these TFs recognized secondary motifs, which in some cases were completely unrelated to the primary element. Analyses of coregulated genes and transcriptomic data from TFs mutants showed the functional significance of over 80\% of all identified sequences and of at least one target sequence per TF. Moreover, combining the target sequence information with coexpression analysis we could predict the function of a TF as activator or repressor through a particular DNA sequence. Our data support the correlation between cis-regulatory elements and the sequence determined in vitro using the protein-binding microarray and provides a framework to explore regulatory networks in plants.},

  abstract = {Each mode of gene duplication (tandem, tetraploid, segmental, transpositional) retains genes in a biased manner. A reciprocal relationship exists between plant genes retained postpaleotetraploidy versus genes retained after an ancient tandem duplication. Among the models (subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, balanced gene drive) and ideas that might explain this relationship, only balanced gene drive predicts reciprocity. The gene balance hypothesis explains that more “connected” genes—by protein-protein interactions in a heteromer, for example—are less likely to be retained as a tandem or transposed duplicate and are more likely to be retained postpaleotetraploidy; otherwise, selectively negative dosage effects are created. Biased duplicate retention is an instant and neutral by-product, a spandrel, of purifying selection. Balanced gene drive expanded plant gene families, including those encoding proteasomal proteins, protein kinases, motors, and transcription factors, with each paleotetraploidy, which could explain trends involving complexity. Balanced gene drive is a saltation mechanism in the mutationist tradition.},

In plants, it has also contributed greatly to crop domestication, as the superior properties of many modern crop plants were conferred by ancient allopolyploidization events. It is generally thought that allopolyploidization occurred through hybridization events between species, accompanied or followed by genome duplication. Although many allopolyploids arose from closely related species (congeners), there are also allopolyploid species that were formed from more distantly related progenitor species belonging to different genera or even different tribes. Here we have examined the possibility that allopolyploidization can also occur by asexual mechanisms. We show that upon grafting--a mechanism of plant-plant interaction that is widespread in nature--entire nuclear genomes can be transferred between plant cells. We provide direct evidence for this process resulting in speciation by creating a new allopolyploid plant species from a herbaceous species and a woody species in the nightshade family. The new species is fertile and produces fertile progeny. Our data highlight natural grafting as a potential asexual mechanism of speciation and also provide a method for the generation of novel allopolyploid crop species.},

  abstract = {Evidence is mounting that the evolution of gene expression plays a major role in adaptation and speciation. Understanding the evolution of gene regulatory regions is indeed an essential step in linking genotypes and phenotypes and in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary change. The common view is that expression traits (protein folding, expression timing, tissue localization and concentration) are under natural selection at the individual level. Here, we use a theoretical approach to show that, in addition, in diploid organisms, enhancer strength (i.e., the ability of enhancers to activate transcription) may increase in a runaway process due to competition for expression between homologous enhancer alleles. These alleles may be viewed as self-promoting genetic elements, as they spread without conferring a benefit at the individual level. They gain a selective advantage by getting associated to better genetic backgrounds: deleterious mutations are more efficiently purged when linked to stronger enhancers. This process, which has been entirely overlooked so far, may help understand the observed overrepresentation of cis-acting regulatory changes in between-species phenotypic differences, and sheds a new light on investigating the contribution of gene expression evolution to adaptation.},

While this implies that the intron must be transcribed to increase expression, the TSS changed when the intron was located in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), suggesting that the intron affects transcription initiation. Remarkably, deleting 303 nucleotides of the promoter including all known TSSs and all but 18 nucleotides of the 5'-UTR had virtually no effect on the level of gene expression as long as an intron containing stimulatory sequences was included. Instead, transcription was initiated in normally untranscribed sequences the same distance upstream of the intron as when the promoter was intact.

  abstract = {AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs) are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that couple perception of the hormone auxin to gene expression programs essential to all land plants. As with many large TF families, a key question is whether individual members determine developmental specificity by binding distinct target genes. We use DAP-seq to generate genome-wide in vitro TF:DNA interaction maps for fourteen maize ARFs from the evolutionarily conserved A and B clades. Comparative analysis reveal a high degree of binding site overlap for ARFs of the same Glade, but largely distinct Glade A and B binding. Many sites are however co-occupied by ARFs from both clades, suggesting transcriptional coordination for many genes. Among these, we investigate known QTLs and use machine learning to predict the impact of cis-regulatory variation. Overall, large-scale comparative analysis of ARF binding suggests that auxin response specificity may be determined by factors other than individual ARF binding site selection.},

  abstract = {Finding the target site and associating in a specific orientation are essential tasks for DNA-binding proteins. In order to make the target search process as efficient as possible, proteins should not only rapidly diffuse to the target site but also dynamically explore multiple local configurations before diffusing away. Protein flipping is an example of this second process that has been observed previously, but the underlying mechanism of flipping remains unclear. Here, we probed the mechanism of protein flipping at the single molecule level, using HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as a model system. In order to test the effects of long-range attractive forces on flipping efficiency, we varied the salt concentration and macromolecular crowding conditions. As expected, increased salt concentrations weaken the binding of RT to DNA while increased crowding strengthens the binding. Moreover, when we analyzed the flipping kinetics, i.e. the rate and probability of flipping, at each condition we found that flipping was more efficient when RT bound more strongly. Our data are consistent with a view that DNA bound proteins undergo multiple rapid re-binding events, or short hops, that allow the protein to explore other configurations without completely dissociating from the DNA.},

When assessed on the basis of the reference annotation, one-third of protein-coding genes are predicted to be disrupted in at least one accession. However, re-annotation of each genome revealed that alternative gene models often restore coding potential. Gene expression in seedlings differed for nearly half of expressed genes and was frequently associated with cis variants within 5 kilobases, as were intron retention alternative splicing events. Sequence and expression variation is most pronounced in genes that respond to the biotic environment. Our data further promote evolutionary and functional studies in A. thaliana, especially the MAGIC genetic reference population descended from these accessions.},

Accurate prediction of polyadenylation sites and identification of motifs that controlling polyadenylation are fundamental for interpreting the patterns of gene expression, improving the accuracy of genome annotation and comprehending the mechanisms that governing gene regulation. Despite considerable advances in using machine learning techniques for this problem, its efficiency is still limited by the lack of experiences and domain knowledge to carefully design and generate useful features, especially for plants. With the increasing availability of extensive genomic data sets and leading computational techniques, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks, have been applied to automatically identify and understand gene regulation directly from gene sequences and predict unknown sequence profiles. Here, we present DeepPolyA, a new deep convolutional neural network-based approach, to predict polyadenylation sites from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana gene sequences. We investigate various deep neural network architectures and evaluate their performance against classical machine learning algorithms and several popular deep learning models. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPolyA is substantially better than competing methods regarding various performance metrics. We further visualize the learned motifs of DeepPolyA to provide insights of our model and learned polyadenylation signals.},

At ionic strengths in the physiological range, the catabolite activator protein (CAP) is shown to form a long-lived complex with the wild type lac promotor, but not with a CAP-insensitive mutant. Formation of a stable "open" or "melted-in" complex of RNA polymerase with the wild type promoter requires the participation of CAP and cyclic AMP. Further, it is demonstrated that even when pre-formed in the presence of CAP-cAMP, the polymerase-promoter open complex becomes unstable if CAP is then selectively removed.},

As a consequence of this insertion, transcriptional enhancers that control the expression of the yellow gene in the wings and body cuticle of adult flies are unable to act on the yellow promoter, resulting in a tissue-specific phenotype characterized by mutant coloration in these structures. Some yellow null alleles (yn) are able to complement the y2 phenotype giving rise to near wild type y2/yn females. The molecular structure of the yellow locus in complementing and noncomplementing mutations was determined by cloning and sequencing the various alleles examined. From the information obtained in these studies, we propose a model suggesting that the complementing wild type phenotype of y2/yn flies might be due to the ability of functional wing and body cuticle transcriptional enhancers located in the yn locus to act in trans on the promoter of the yellow gene found in the y2-containing chromosome. Furthermore, this transactivation is abolished by the presence of an intact promoter in cis, suggesting that promoter competition between the yellow genes located on each homolog precludes the activation in trans by transcriptional enhancers in favour of cis effects on their own promoter.},

Here we demonstrate a simple procedure for the isolation of nucleosome-depleted DNA from human chromatin, termed FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements). To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a DNA microarray. FAIRE performed in human cells strongly enriches DNA coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, and active promoters. Evidence for cell-type–specific patterns of FAIRE enrichment is also presented. FAIRE has utility as a positive selection for genomic regions associated with regulatory activity, including regions traditionally detected by nuclease hypersensitivity assays.},

TFs are central to organismal development, and morphology; therefore, they potentially are instrumental in producing phenotypic diversity. We measured TF abundance of 49 major TF DBD families in 48 bird genomes, which we then compared with 5 reptile genomes, in an effort to assess the degree to which TF DBD are potentially connected to increased phenotypic diversity in the avian lineage. We hypothesized that there would be increased TF DBD abundance in multiple TF families correlated with the increased phenotypic diversity found in birds; instead ultimately, we see a general loss of major TF DBD families, reflecting general genome reductions seen between reptiles and birds, with largest losses in TF DBD families associated with multiple developmental (feather, sex-determination, body-plan, immune, blood) and metabolic processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of -omics data is driving the development of computational methods for integrating these datasets to connect the underlying molecular mechanisms to phenotypes. Building gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from transcriptomic studies often results in a static view of gene expression, which can make it difficult to disentangle pathway structure. Increasing the temporal resolution of any experimental design provides the opportunity to model the dynamic nature of a regulatory pathway response to a stimulus. Many transient intermediate states can separate the initial prestimulus state from the final poststimulus state; time-series analyses permit the detection and integration of these intermediate steps into the pathway. The difficulty is to incorporate these time-dependent changes to determine causal relationships within the GRN, such as which transcription factor (TF) regulates which target genes. In PNAS, Varala et al. (1) address this challenge by integrating time into their GRN to unravel the temporal cascade of nitrogen signaling. Their time-based analysis offers a potent and general approach to uncover the temporal transcriptional logic for any plant or animal response system.Nitrogen (N) commonly limits plant production and the widespread application of mineral N fertilizer has greatly increased crop yields (2). Unfortunately, the production of mineral N fertilizer is expensive in terms of fossil energy. Furthermore, plant assimilation of applied N is inefficient; for example, cereals such as maize, rice, and wheat take up less than 40\% of the applied N (3). The remaining N is lost to the environment through processes including denitrification and volatilization, releasing greenhouse gases, leaching, contaminating groundwater, and surface runoff, causing eutrophication of fresh and estuarine waters (4). Therefore, the excessive use of N fertilizer both increases the cost of crop production and causes environmental pollution. One might expect that, consequently, plant N use efficiency (NUE) would represent a major target for … ↵1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: c.robertson.mcclung\{at\}Dartmouth.edu.},

  abstract = {Zinc finger transcription factors (TFsZF) were designed and applied to transgene and endogenous gene regulation in stably transformed plants. The target of the TFsZF is the Arabidopsis gene APETALA3 (AP3), which encodes a transcription factor that determines floral organ identity. A zinc finger protein (ZFP) was designed to specifically bind to a region upstream of AP3. AP3 transcription was induced by transformation of leaf protoplasts with a transformation vector that expressed a TFZF consisting of the ZFP fused to the tetrameric repeat of herpes simplex VP16's minimal activation domain. Histochemical staining of β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic AP3∷GUS reporter plants expressing GUS under control of the AP3 promoter was increased dramatically in petals when the AP3-specific TFZF activator was cointroduced. TFZF-amplified GUS expression signals were also evident in sepal tissues of these double-transgenic plants. Floral phenotype changes indicative of endogenous AP3 factor coactivation were also observed. The same AP3-specific ZFPAP3 was also fused to a human transcriptional repression domain, the mSIN3 interaction domain, and introduced into either AP3∷GUS-expressing plants or wild-type Arabidopsis plants. Dramatic repression of endogenous AP3 expression in floral tissue resulted when a constitutive promoter was used to drive the expression of this TFZF. These plants were also sterile. When a floral tissue-specific promoter from APETALA1 (AP1) gene was used, floral phenotype changes were also observed, but in contrast the plants were fertile. Our results demonstrate that artificial transcriptional factors based on synthetic zinc finger proteins are capable of stable and specific regulation of endogenous genes through multiple generations in multicellular organisms.},

  abstract = {Stress is any physical, psychological, and/or environmental stimulus capable of altering physiological homeostasis, and the ability to cope with such stressful stimuli is a crucial determinant of health and disease. Several aggressive and defensive factors are involved in the organization of a stress response, and maintenance of a balance results from an interaction between complex neurochemical pathways. Conventional antistress agents like benzodiazepines, although effective, have a plethora of undesirable effects that restricts their long-term use, and thus there is a constant search for more effective and safer agents. Nutraceuticals are food additives and/or nutritional supplements used for the prevention and treatment of many diseases as well as for maintenance of normal well-being. Some such nutraceuticals known as adaptogens primarily obtained from herbal sources (medicinal plants) act as antistress agents and, in recent years, have gained considerable attention because of their safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Experimental and clinical studies have validated their uses, and much scientific research has clarified their efficacy and safety issues in human diseases. In view of this and the increasing awareness of the population about lifestyle disorders, the use of such nutraceuticals may revolutionize the management of some of these debilitating disease states. It is suggested that due to their antistress effects, adaptogens could not only help to counteract stress effects on the biological system but also increase nonspecific resistance to a variety of other aversive stimuli. This, in turn, could be helpful in protecting against stress-related diseases and in improving the quality of life.},

The first is the existence of duplicate genes: that is, the loss of function in one copy can be compensated by the other copy or copies. The second mechanism of compensation stems from alternative metabolic pathways, regulatory networks, and so on. The relative importance of the two mechanisms has not been investigated except for a limited study, which suggested that the role of duplicate genes in compensation is negligible10. The availability of fitness data for a nearly complete set of single-gene-deletion mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome11 has enabled us to carry out a genome-wide evaluation of the role of duplicate genes in genetic robustness against null mutations. Here we show that there is a significantly higher probability of functional compensation for a duplicate gene than for a singleton, a high correlation between the frequency of compensation and the sequence similarity of two duplicates, and a higher probability of a severe fitness effect when the duplicate copy that is more highly expressed is deleted. We estimate that in S. cerevisiae at least a quarter of those gene deletions that have no phenotype are compensated by duplicate genes.},

Here we uncovered the role of SWI3B, a subunit of the Arabidopsis thaliana SWI/SNF complex, via RNA interference. Knockdown of SWI3\,B resulted in an upward-curling leaf phenotype. Further investigation showed that the RNA level of IAA carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (IAMT1), encoding an enzyme involved in auxin metabolism, was dramatically elevated in the knockdown (SWI3B-RNAi) plants. In addition, activation of IAMT1 produced a leaf-curling phenotype similar to that of the SWI3B-RNAi lines. Database analysis suggested that the last intron of IAMT contains a site of polymerase V (Pol\,V) stabilized nucleosome, which may be associated with SWI3B. Data from a micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion assay showed that nucleosome occupancy around this site was downregulated in the leaves of SWI3B-RNAi plants.

  abstract = {DNA methylation promotes transcription
DNA methylation generally represses transcription, but in some instances, it has also been implicated in transcription activation. Harris et al. identified a protein complex in Arabidopsis that is recruited to chromatin by DNA methylation. This complex specifically activated the transcription of genes that are already mildly transcribed but had no effect on transcriptionally silent genes such as transposable elements. The complex thereby counteracts the repression effect caused by transposon insertion in neighboring genes while leaving transposons silent. Thus, by balancing both repressive and activating transcriptional effects, DNA methylation can act to fine-tune gene expression.
Science, this issue p. 1182
DNA methylation generally functions as a repressive transcriptional signal, but it is also known to activate gene expression. In either case, the downstream factors remain largely unknown. By using comparative interactomics, we isolated proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana that associate with methylated DNA. Two SU(VAR)3-9 homologs, the transcriptional antisilencing factor SUVH1, and SUVH3, were among the methyl reader candidates. SUVH1 and SUVH3 bound methylated DNA in vitro, were associated with euchromatic methylation in vivo, and formed a complex with two DNAJ domain-containing homologs, DNAJ1 and DNAJ2. Ectopic recruitment of DNAJ1 enhanced gene transcription in plants, yeast, and mammals. Thus, the SUVH proteins bind to methylated DNA and recruit the DNAJ proteins to enhance proximal gene expression, thereby counteracting the repressive effects of transposon insertion near genes.
A protein complex that binds methylated DNA can counteract the repressive effects of transposon invasion on neighboring gene expression.

Fine-tuning of gene expression is often needed to maximize product yield and quality. However, for efficient knowledge-based engineering, a better understanding of promoter function is indispensable. Consequently, we created a promoter library by deletion and duplication of putative transcription factor-binding sites within the AOX1 promoter (PAOX1) sequence. This first library initially spanned an activity range between ∼6\% and {$>$}160\% of the wild-type promoter activity. After characterization of the promoter library employing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant, the new regulatory toolbox was successfully utilized in a ‘real case’, i.e. the expression of industrial enzymes. Characterization of the library under repressing, derepressing and inducing conditions displayed at least 12 cis-acting elements involved in PAOX1-driven high-level expression. Based on this deletion analysis, novel short artificial promoter variants were constructed by combining cis-acting elements with basal promoter. In addition to improving yields and quality of heterologous protein production, the new PAOX1 synthetic promoter library constitutes a basic toolbox to fine-tune gene expression in metabolic engineering and sequential induction of protein expression in synthetic biology.},

Conservation across orthologous bases suggests that at least 17\% of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome is under selection, with nearly one-quarter of the sequence under selection lying outside of coding regions. Much of this sequence can be localized to approximately 90,000 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) that show evidence of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Population genomics analyses of two crucifer species, A. thaliana and Capsella grandiflora, confirm that most of the identified CNSs are evolving under medium to strong purifying selection.

  abstract = {Extracts of guarana (Paullinia cupana) feature as putatively stimulating ingredients in a number of foods, drinks and dietary/herbal supplements. The objective of this work was to investigate in vitro the transdermal delivery of the major pharmacologically active compounds contained in guarana extract. Saturated solutions of guarana were prepared in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400), propylene glycol (PG) and H2O at 32°C. Guarana extract was also formulated in Duro-tak® 2287 transdermal adhesive in a range of concentrations and the diffusional release was determined in addition to adhesive properties. Transdermal delivery across full thickness pig ear skin was investigated in vitro using Franz-type diffusion cells, with reverse-phase HPLC being used for the quantification of the permeation of theobromine (TB), theophylline (TP), (+)-catechin (C) and caffeine (CF). Based upon a combination of release and adhesive property data a patch containing 5.55mg guarana extract cm−2 was deemed optimal. The general trend for the delivery of the 4 analytes was: water {$>$}5.55mgcm−2 patch ≈PG{$>$}PEG400. For CF the greatest steady state flux was obtained from the water vehicle: 19μgcm−2h−1, with ∼420μgcm−2 permeating after 24h. This was some 6× times more than from the drug-in-adhesive patch and 10× greater than PG, a well-known penetration enhancer, and 50× that of the ‘regular’ excipient PEG400. A water vehicle also provided the greatest delivery of TB (0.45μgcm−2h−1), TP (0.022μgcm−2h−1), and C (0.10μgcm−2h−1). An inverse relationship was noted between lipophilicity and kp in each vehicle. The simultaneous transdermal delivery of the major actives of guarana was established, with permeation rates being highly concentration and vehicle dependent.},

We found that partially unwrapped nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles can occupy the same position within a cell population, suggesting dynamic behavior. By varying the time of MNase digestion, we have been able to observe changes that reflect differential sensitivity of particles, including the eviction of nucleosomes. To characterize DNA-binding features of transcription factors, we plotted the length of each fragment versus its position in the genome, which defined the minimal protected region of each factor. This process led to the precise mapping of protected and exposed regions at and around binding sites, and also determination of the degree to which they are flanked by phased nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles. Our protocol and mapping method provide a general strategy for epigenome characterization, including nucleosome phasing and dynamics, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers, and transcription factors, from a single-sequenced sample.},

Previously, we showed that G564 mRNA, encoding a protein of unknown function, accumulates to high levels in the giant suspensor of both Scarlet Runner Bean (SRB) and Common Bean embryos, and a cis-regulatory module containing three unique DNA sequences, designated as the 10-bp, Region 2, and Fifth motifs, is required for G564 suspensor-specific transcription [Henry KF, et al. (2015) Plant Mol Biol 88:207–217; Kawashima T, et al. (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:3627–3632]. We tested the hypothesis that these motifs are also required for transcription of the SRB GA 20-oxidase gene, which encodes a gibberellic acid hormone biosynthesis enzyme and is coexpressed with G564 at a high level in giant bean suspensors. We used deletion and gain-of-function experiments in transgenic tobacco embryos to show that two GA 20-oxidase DNA regions are required for suspensor-specific transcription, one in the 5′ UTR (+119 to +205) and another in the 5′ upstream region (−341 to −316). Mutagenesis of sequences in these two regions determined that the cis-regulatory motifs required for G564 suspensor transcription are also required for GA 20-oxidase transcription within the suspensor, although the motif arrangement differs. Our results demonstrate the flexibility of motif positioning within a cis-regulatory module that activates gene transcription within giant bean suspensors and suggest that G564 and GA 20-oxidase comprise part of a suspensor gene regulatory network.},

In contrast, the subfunctionalization (SF) hypothesis argues that duplicate genes experience degenerate mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We here show that neither NF nor SF alone adequately explains the genome-wide patterns of yeast protein interaction and human gene expression for duplicate genes. Instead, our analysis reveals rapid SF, accompanied by prolonged and substantial NF in a large proportion of duplicate genes, suggesting a new model termed subneofunctionalization (SNF).

We studied the key experimental parameters to optimize performance of DNase-seq. Sequencing short fragments of 50–100 base pairs (bp) that accumulate in long internucleosome linker regions was more efficient for identifying transcription factor binding sites compared to sequencing longer fragments. We also assessed the potential of DNase-seq to predict transcription factor occupancy via generation of nucleotide-resolution transcription factor footprints. In modeling the sequence-specific DNase I cutting bias, we found a strong effect that varied over more than two orders of magnitude. This indicates that the nucleotide-resolution cleavage patterns at many transcription factor binding sites are derived from intrinsic DNase I cleavage bias rather than from specific protein-DNA interactions. In contrast, quantitative comparison of DNase I hypersensitivity between states can predict transcription factor occupancy associated with particular biological perturbations.},

Large-scale prediction of promoter sequences and their contributing cis-acting elements has become routine due to recent advances in transcriptomic technologies and genome sequencing of several plants. However, predicted regulatory sequences may or may not be functional and demonstration of the contribution of the element to promoter activity is essential for confirmation of regulatory sequences. Synthetic promoters and introns provide useful approaches for functional validation of promoter sequences. The development and improvement of gene expression tools for rapid, efficient, predictable, and high-throughput analysis of promoter components will be critical for confirmation of the functional regulatory element sequences identified through transcriptomic and genomic analyses.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is a major mechanism used by plants to confer phenotypic plasticity, and yet compared with other eukaryotes or bacteria, little is known about the design principles. We generated an extensive catalog of nascent and steady-state transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), 5′GRO-seq, and RNA-seq and reanalyzed published maize data to capture characteristics of plant transcription. De novo annotation of nascent transcripts accurately mapped start sites and unstable transcripts. Examining the promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts identified comparable chromatin signatures, a conserved “TGT” core promoter motif and unreported transcription factor-binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases showed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter-proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis seedlings and maize, which are commonly present in yeast and humans. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases in proximity of the polyadenylation site, a trend that coincided with longer genes and CpG hypomethylation. Lack of promoter-proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady-state transcripts indicate Arabidopsis may regulate transcription predominantly at the level of initiation.

  abstract = {One increasingly popular type of alternative therapy is aromatherapy, but scientific validation in this field is still rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rose oil (Rosa damascena Mill, Rosaceae) on human autonomic parameters and emotional responses in healthy subjects after transdermal absorption. In order to exclude any olfactory stimulation the inhalation of the fragrances was prevented by breathing masks. Forty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. Five autonomic parameters, i.e. blood pressure, breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and skin temperature, were recorded. Emotional responses were assessed by means of rating scales. Compared to placebo, rose oil caused significant decreases of breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure, which indicate a decrease of autonomic arousal. At the emotional level, subjects in the rose oil group rated themselves as more calm, more relaxed and less alert than subjects in the control group. These findings are likely to represent a relaxing effect of the rose oil and provide some evidence for the use of rose oil in aromatherapy, such as causing relief of depression and stress in humans.},

  abstract = {HY5 (Long Hypocotyles 5) is a key transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana that has a pivotal role in seedling development. Soil nitrogen is an essential macronutrient, and its uptake, assimilation and metabolism are influenced by nutrient availability and by lights. To understand the role of HY5 in nitrogen assimilation pathways, we examined the phenotype as well as the expression of selected nitrogen assimilation-related genes in hy5 mutant grown under various nitrogen limiting and nitrogen sufficient conditions, or different light conditions. We report that HY5 positively regulates nitrite reductase gene NIR1 and negatively regulates the ammonium transporter gene AMT1;2 under all nitrogen and light conditions tested, while it affects several other genes in a nitrogen supply-dependent manner. HY5 is not required for light induction of NIR1, AMT1;2 and NIA genes, but it is necessary for high level expression of NIR1 and NIA under optimal nutrient and light conditions. In addition, nitrogen deficiency exacerbates the abnormal root system of hy5. Together, our results suggest that HY5 exhibits the growth-promoting activity only when sufficient nutrients, including lights, are provided, and that HY5 has a complex involvement in nitrogen acquisition and metabolism in Arabidopsis seedlings.},

  abstract = {5-Methylcytosine, a chemical modification of DNA, is a covalent modification found in the genomes of both plants and animals. Epigenetic inheritance of phenotypes mediated by DNA methylation is well established in plants. Most of the known mechanisms of establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation have been worked out in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Major functions of DNA methylation in plants include regulation of gene expression and silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and repetitive sequences, both of which have parallels in mammalian biology, involve interaction with the transcriptional machinery, and may have profound effects on the regulatory networks in the cell. Methylome and transcriptome dynamics have been investigated in development and environmental responses in Arabidopsis and agriculturally and ecologically important plants, revealing the interdependent relationship among genomic context, methylation patterns, and expression of TE and protein coding genes. Analyses of methylome variation among plant natural populations and species have begun to quantify the extent of genetic control of methylome variation vs. true epimutation, and model the evolutionary forces driving methylome evolution in both short and long time scales. The ability of DNA methylation to positively or negatively modulate binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs) provides a natural link from genome sequence and methylation changes to transcription. Technologies that allow systematic determination of methylation sensitivities of TFs, in native genomic and methylation context without confounding factors such as histone modifications, will provide baseline datasets for building cell-type- and individual-specific regulatory networks that underlie the establishment and inheritance of complex traits.

Transcriptomic responses to genomic merger and doubling have been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance and revamping of co-expression networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there remains a need to develop a conceptual framework that will stimulate a deeper understanding of these diverse phenomena and their mechanistic interrelationships. Here we introduce considerations relevant to this framework with a focus on cis-trans interactions among duplicated genes and alleles in hybrids and allopolyploids. By extending classic allele-specific expression analysis to the allopolyploid level, we distinguish the distinct effects of progenitor regulatory interactions from the novel intergenomic interactions that arise from genome merger and allopolyploidization. This perspective informs experiments designed to reveal the molecular genetic basis of gene regulatory control, and will facilitate the disentangling of genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression. Finally, we suggest that the extended cis-trans model may help conceptually unify several presently disparate hallmarks of allopolyploid evolution, including genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation, and lead to a new level of understanding of phenotypic novelty accompanying polyploidy.},

We identify the cis and trans determinants of nucleosome positioning using a functional evolutionary approach involving S. cerevisiae strains containing large genomic regions from other yeast species. In a foreign species, nucleosome depletion at promoters is maintained over poly(dA:dT) tracts, whereas internucleosome spacing and all other aspects of nucleosome positioning tested are not. Interestingly, the locations of the +1 nucleosome and RNA start sites shift in concert. Strikingly, in a foreign species, nucleosome-depleted regions occur fortuitously in coding regions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned nucleosome array linked to the length of the transcription unit. We suggest a three-step model, in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.},

By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.},

  abstract = {Single cell RNA sequencing can yield high-resolution cell-type–specific expression signatures that reveal new cell types and the developmental trajectories of cell lineages. Here, we apply this approach to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root cells to capture gene expression in 3,121 root cells. We analyze these data with Monocle 3, which orders single cell transcriptomes in an unsupervised manner and uses machine learning to reconstruct single cell developmental trajectories along pseudotime. We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type–specific expression, with pseudotime analysis of several cell lineages revealing both known and novel genes that are expressed along a developmental trajectory. We identify transcription factor motifs that are enriched in early and late cells, together with the corresponding candidate transcription factors that likely drive the observed expression patterns. We assess and interpret changes in total RNA expression along developmental trajectories and show that trajectory branch points mark developmental decisions. Finally, by applying heat stress to whole seedlings, we address the longstanding question of possible heterogeneity among cell types in the response to an abiotic stress. Although the response of canonical heat-shock genes dominates expression across cell types, subtle but significant differences in other genes can be detected among cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrate that single cell transcriptomics holds promise for studying plant development and plant physiology with unprecedented resolution.},

  abstract = {TFs (transcription factors) are modular proteins minimally containing a DBD (DNA-binding domain) and a TRD (transcription regulatory domain). NAC [for NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF, CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)] proteins comprise one of the largest plant TF families. They are key regulators of stress perception and developmental programmes, and most share an N-terminal NAC domain. On the basis of analyses of gene expression data and the phylogeny of Arabidopsis thaliana NAC TFs we systematically decipher structural and functional specificities of the conserved NAC domains and the divergent C-termini. Nine of the ten NAC domains analysed bind a previously identified conserved DNA target sequence with a CGT[GA] core, although with different affinities. Likewise, all but one of the NAC proteins analysed is dependent on the C-terminal region for transactivational activity. In silico analyses show that the NAC TRDs contain group-specific sequence motifs and are characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder. Furthermore, ANAC019 was identified as a new positive regulator of ABA (abscisic acid) signalling, conferring ABA hypersensitivity when ectopically expressed in plants. Interestingly, ectopic expression of the ANAC019 DBD or TRD alone also resulted in ABA hypersensitivity. Expression of stress-responsive marker genes [COR47 (cold-responsive 47), RD29b (responsive-to-desiccation 29b) and ERD11 (early-responsive-to-dehydration 11)] were also induced by full-length and truncated ANAC019. Domain-swapping experiments were used to analyse the specificity of this function. Chimaeric proteins, where the NAC domain of ANAC019 was replaced with the analogous regions from other NAC TFs, also have the ability to positively regulate ABA signalling. In contrast, replacing the ANAC019 TRD with other TRDs abolished ANAC019-mediated ABA hypersensitivity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the biochemical and functional specificity of NAC TFs is associated with both the DBDs and the TRDs.},

The ranking of the promoter activities was somewhat different when assayed inEscherichia coli, but the promoters are efficient for modulating gene expression in this bacterium as well. DNA sequencing revealed that the weaker promoters (which had activities below 5 relative units) all had changes either in the consensus sequences or in the length of the spacer between the −35 and −10 sequences. The promoters in which those features were conserved had activities from 5 to 2,050 U, which shows that by randomizing the spacers, at least a 400-fold change in activity can be obtained. Interestingly, the entire range of promoter activities is covered in small steps of activity increase, which makes these promoters very suitable for quantitative physiological studies and for fine-tuning of gene expression in industrial bioreactors and cell factories.},

Furthermore, HSP90 protein was identified by mass spectrometry as the protein preferentially associated with the maize hsp101 IRES.

Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4,5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G{$>$}C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.},

Eukaryotic promoter regions are frequently divergently transcribed in~vivo, but it is unknown whether the resultant antisense RNAs are a mechanistic by-product of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription or biologically meaningful. Here, we use a functional evolutionary approach that involves nascent transcript mapping in S.~cerevisiae strains containing foreign yeast DNA. Promoter regions in foreign environments lose the directionality they have in their native species. Strikingly, fortuitous promoter regions arising in foreign DNA produce equal transcription in both directions, indicating that divergent transcription is a mechanistic feature that does not imply a function for these transcripts. Fortuitous promoter regions arising during evolution promote bidirectional transcription and over time are purged through mutation or retained to enable new functionality. Similarly, human transcription is more bidirectional at newly evolved enhancers and promoter regions. Thus, promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional and are shaped by evolution to bias transcription toward coding versus non-coding RNAs.},

To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element–1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [±50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area ≥ 0.96] and statistical confidence (P {$<$}10–4), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase II core promoter is sometimes referred to as the gateway to transcription. The core promoter is generally defined to be the stretch of DNA that directs the initiation of transcription. This simple description belies a complex multidimensional regulatory element, as there is considerable diversity in core promoter structure and function. Core promoters can be viewed at the levels of DNA sequences, transcription factors, and biological networks. Key DNA sequences are known as core promoter elements, which include the TATA box, initiator (Inr), TCT, BRE, MTE, and DPE motifs. There are no universal core promoter elements that are present in all promoters. Different types of core promoters are transcribed by different sets of transcription factors and exhibit distinct properties, such as specific interactions with transcriptional enhancers, that are determined by the presence or absence of particular core promoter motifs. Moreover, some core promoter elements have been found to be associated with specific biological networks. For instance, the TCT motif is dedicated to the transcription of ribosomal protein genes in Drosophila and humans. In addition, nearly all of the Drosophila Hox genes have a DPE motif in their core promoters. The complexity of the core promoter is further seen in the relation among transcription initiation patterns, the stability or lability of transcriptional states, and the organization of the chromatin structure in the promoter region. Hence, the current data indicate that the core promoter is a critical component in the regulation of gene activity.},

  abstract = {Plant species have evolved myriads of solutions to adapt to dynamic environments, including complex cell type development and regulation. To understand this diversity, we profiled tomato root cell type translatomes and chromatin accessibility. Using xylem differentiation in tomato, relative to Arabidopsis, examples of functional innovation, repurposing and conservation of transcription factors are described. Repurposing and innovation of genes are further observed within an exodermis regulatory network and illustrate its function. Translatome analyses of rice, tomato and Arabidopsis tissues suggest that root meristems are more conserved, and that the functions of constitutively expressed genes are more conserved than those of cell type/tissue-enriched genes. These observations suggest that higher-order properties of cell type and pan-cell type regulation are conserved between plants and animals.One Sentence Summary Pan-species cell type translatome and chromatin accessibility data reveal novelty, conservation and repurposing of gene function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Analysis of cis-element distribution revealed the functional multiplicity of PRs and provides insight into the gene regulation.

  abstract = {Summary
The epigenome orchestrates genome accessibility,~functionality, and three-dimensional structure. Because epigenetic variation can impact transcription and thus phenotypes, it may contribute to adaptation. Here, we report 1,107 high-quality single-base resolution methylomes and 1,203 transcriptomes from the 1001 Genomes collection of Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the genetic basis of methylation variation is highly complex, geographic origin is a major predictor of genome-wide DNA methylation levels and of altered gene expression caused by epialleles. Comparison to cistrome and epicistrome datasets identifies associations between transcription factor binding sites, methylation, nucleotide variation, and co-expression modules. Physical maps for nine of the most diverse genomes reveal how transposons and other structural variants shape the epigenome, with dramatic effects on immunity genes. The 1001 Epigenomes Project provides a comprehensive resource for understanding how variation in DNA methylation contributes to molecular and non-molecular phenotypes in natural populations of the most studied model plant.},

  abstract = {Exploring novel computational methods in making sense of biological data has not only been a necessity, but also productive. A part of this trend is the search for more efficient in silico methods/tools for analysis of promoters, which are parts of DNA sequences that are involved in regulation of expression of genes into other functional molecules. Promoter regions vary greatly in their function based on the sequence of nucleotides and the arrangement of protein-binding short-regions called motifs. In fact, the regulatory nature of the promoters seems to be largely driven by the selective presence and/or the arrangement of these motifs. Here, we explore computational classification of promoter sequences based on the pattern of motif distributions, as such classification can pave a new way of functional analysis of promoters and to discover the functionally crucial motifs. We make use of Position Specific Motif Matrix (PSMM) features for exploring the possibility of accurately classifying promoter sequences using some of the popular classification techniques. The classification results on the complete feature set are low, perhaps due to the huge number of features. We propose two ways of reducing features. Our test results show improvement in the classification output after the reduction of features. The results also show that decision trees outperform SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) and ensemble classifier LibD3C, particularly with reduced features. The proposed feature selection methods outperform some of the popular feature transformation methods such as PCA and SVD. Also, the methods proposed are as accurate as MRMR (feature selection method) but much faster than MRMR. Such methods could be useful to categorize new promoters and explore regulatory mechanisms of gene expressions in complex eukaryotic species.},

Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, NOMe-seq obtains DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same DNA molecule, giving the first genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.},

Although recent research has demonstrated modulation of mood in keeping with these roles, no studies to date have directly investigated the effects of this herbal medication on laboratory-induced psychological stress.
        Methods:~In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, balanced crossover experiment, 18 healthy volunteers received two separate single doses of a standardized M. officinalis extract (300 mg, 600 mg) and a placebo, on separate days separated by a 7-day washout period. Modulation of mood was assessed during predose and 1-hour postdose completions of a 20-minute version of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) battery. Cognitive performance on the four concurrent tasks of the battery was also assessed.
        Results:~The results showed that the 600-mg dose of Melissa ameliorated the negative mood effects of the DISS, with significantly increased self-ratings of calmness and reduced self-ratings of alertness. In addition, a significant increase in the speed of mathematical processing, with no reduction in accuracy, was observed after ingestion of the 300-mg dose.
        Conclusion:~These results suggest that the potential for M. officinalis to mitigate the effects of stress deserves further investigation.},

  abstract = {Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) is a traditional herbal medicine, which enjoys contemporary usage as a mild sedative, spasmolytic and antibacterial agent. It has been suggested, in light of in vitro cholinergic binding properties, that Melissa extracts may effectively ameliorate the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. To date, no study has investigated the effects on cognition and mood of administration of Melissa to healthy humans. The present randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced-crossover study investigated the acute effects on cognition and mood of a standardised extract of M. officinalis. Twenty healthy, young participants received single doses of 300, 600 and 900 mg of M. officinalis (Pharmaton) or a matching placebo at 7-day intervals. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerised test battery and two serial subtraction tasks immediately prior to dosing and at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 h thereafter. In vitro IC50 concentrations for the displacement of [3H]-(N)-nicotine and [3H]-(N)-scopolamine from nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in human occipital cortex tissue were also calculated. Results, utilising the cognitive factors previously derived from the CDR battery, included a sustained improvement in Accuracy of Attention following 600 mg of Melissa and time- and dose-specific reductions in both Secondary Memory and Working Memory factors. Self-rated “calmness,” as assessed by Bond–Lader mood scales, was elevated at the earliest time points by the lowest dose, whilst “alertness” was significantly reduced at all time points following the highest dose. Both nicotinic and muscarinic binding were found to be low in comparison to the levels found in previous studies.},

The current study combined an in~vitro investigation of the cholinesterase inhibitory properties and phytochemical constituents of a S. lavandulaefolia essential oil, with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study assessing the effects of a single dose on cognitive performance and mood. In this latter investigation 36 healthy participants received capsules containing either 50\,µL of the essential oil or placebo on separate occasions, 7 days apart. Cognitive function was assessed using a selection of computerized memory and attention tasks and the Cognitive Demand Battery before the treatment and 1-h and 4-h post-dose. The essential oil was a potent inhibitor of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and consisted almost exclusively of monoterpenoids. Oral consumption lead to improved performance of secondary memory and attention tasks, most notably at the 1-h post-dose testing session, and reduced mental fatigue and increased alertness which were more pronounced 4-h post-dose. These results extend previous observations of improved cognitive performance and mood following AChE inhibitory sage extracts and suggest that the ability of well-tolerated terpenoid-containing extracts to beneficially modulate cholinergic function and cognitive performance deserves further attention.},

  abstract = {Developmental programs sculpt plant morphology to meet environmental challenges, and these same programs have been manipulated to increase agricultural productivity (Doebley et al., 1997; Khush, 2001). Hormones coordinate these programs, creating chemical circuitry (Vanstraelen and Benková, 2012) that has been represented in mathematical models (Refahi et al., 2016; Prusinkiewicz et al., 2009); however, model-guided engineering of plant morphology has been limited by a lack of tools (Parry et al., 2009; Voytas and Gao, 2014). Here, we introduce a novel set of synthetic and modular hormone activated Cas9-based repressors (HACRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana that respond to three hormones: auxin, gibberellins and jasmonates. We demonstrate that HACRs are sensitive to both exogenous hormone treatments and local differences in endogenous hormone levels associated with development. We further show that this capability can be leveraged to reprogram development in an agriculturally relevant manner by changing how the hormonal circuitry regulates target genes. By deploying a HACR to re-parameterize the auxin-induced expression of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), we decreased shoot branching and phyllotactic noise, as predicted by existing models (Refahi et al., 2016; Prusinkiewicz et al., 2009).},

Despite aromatherapy's popularity, efficacy data are scant, and potential mechanisms are controversial. This randomized controlled trial examined the psychological, autonomic, endocrine, and immune consequences of one purported relaxant odor (lavender), one stimulant odor (lemon), and a no-odor control (water), before and after a stressor (cold pressor); 56 healthy men and women were exposed to each of the odors during three separate visits. To assess the effects of expectancies, participants randomized to the “blind” condition were given no information about the odors they would smell; “primed” individuals were told what odors they would smell during the session, and what changes to expect. Experimenters were blind. Self-report and unobtrusive mood measures provided robust evidence that lemon oil reliably enhances positive mood compared to water and lavender regardless of expectancies or previous use of aromatherapy. Moreover, norepinephrine levels following the cold pressor remained elevated when subjects smelled lemon, compared to water or lavender. DTH responses to Candida were larger following inhalation of water than lemon or lavender. Odors did not reliably alter IL-6 and IL-10 production, salivary cortisol, heart rate or blood pressure, skin barrier repair following tape stripping, or pain ratings following the cold pressor.},

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms the specification of distinct tissues within organs allows compartmentation of complex processes. However, the mechanisms that allow gene expression to be restricted to such tissues are poorly understood. To better understand this process, we focused on bundle sheath expression of the gene encoding the MYB76 transcription factor in
            
            . Functional and computational analyses were combined to identify a seven-nucleotide motif within a DNaseI hypersensitive site in the

A gene expression signature based on the top screening hits correlated with markers of BRAF inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples.

  abstract = {Nitrate is a major nitrogen source for land plants and also acts as a signaling molecule that induces changes in growth and gene expression. To identify the cis-acting DNA element involved in nitrate-responsive gene expression, we analyzed the promoter of the Arabidopsis gene encoding nitrite reductase (NIR1). A region from positions −188 to −1, relative to the translation start site, was found to contain at least one cis-element necessary for the nitrate-dependent activation of the promoter, in which the activity of nitrate transporter NRT2.1 and/or NRT2.2 plays a critical role. To define this nitrate-responsive cis-element (NRE), we compared the sequences of several nitrite reductase gene promoters from various higher plants and identified a conserved sequence motif as the putative NRE. A synthetic promoter in which the four copies of a 43-bp sequence containing the motif were fused to the 35S minimal promoter was found to direct nitrate-responsive transcription. Furthermore, mutations within this conserved motif in the native NIR1 promoter markedly reduced the nitrate-responsive activity of the promoter, indicating that the 43-bp sequence is an NRE that is both necessary and sufficient for nitrate-responsive transcription. We also show that both the native NIR1 promoter and the synthetic promoter display a similar level of sensitivity to nitrate, but respond differentially to exogenously supplied glutamine, indicating independent modulation of NIR1 expression by NRE-mediated nitrate induction and feedback repression mediated by other cis-element(s). These findings thus define the presence of multiple cis-elements involved in the nitrogen response in Arabidopsis.},

The two promoters Pcec and PcamIII were deployed for development of insect-resistant transgenic tomato with optimal expression of modified cry1Ac insecticidal toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The transgenic status and copy number of the cry1Ac in T(0) transgenic tomato was confirmed through PCR, Southern hybridization, RT-PCR and Western immunoassay, while toxin expression was monitored by DAS-ELISA. The expression level of Cry1Ac toxin driven by Pcec in T(0) population ranged from 0.08 to 0.8\% of total soluble protein (TSP) that was significantly higher to PcamIII which ranged from 0.02 to 0.13\% of TSP. The outcome of insect mortality bioassay with Helicoverpa armigera correlated well with the results of DAS-ELISA. The higher expression of cry1Ac gene driven by Pcec promoter in transgenic tomato did not show any yield penalty and reflected complete protection, while low recovery of promising transgenics expressing Cry1Ac toxin driven by PcamIII was a major limitation for complete protection against the fruit borer insect.},

These studies revealed that ∼40\% of all budding yeast protein-coding genes possess a unique promoter structure, where we propose that an unusually unstable nucleosome forms immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). This "fragile" nucleosome (FN) promoter architecture relies on the combined action of the essential RSC (Remodels Structure of Chromatin) nucleosome remodeler and pioneer transcription factors (PTFs). FNs are associated with genes whose expression is high, coupled to cell growth, and characterized by low cell-to-cell variability (noise), suggesting that they may promote these features. Recent studies in metazoans suggest that the presence of dynamic nucleosomes upstream of the TSS at highly expressed genes may be conserved throughout evolution.},

Here we present evidence that there are two distinct types of promoters distinguished by the resistance of the À1 nucleosome to micrococcal nuclease digestion. These different architectures are characterized by two sequence motifs that are broadly deployed at one set of promoters where a nuclease-sensitive (‘‘fragile’’) nucleosome forms, but concentrated in a narrower, nucleosome-free region at all other promoters. The RSC nucleosome remodeler acts through the motifs to establish stable +1 and À1 nucleosome positions, while binding of a small set of general regulatory (pioneer) factors at fragile nucleosome promoters plays a key role in their destabilization. We propose that the fragile nucleosome promoter architecture is adapted for regulation of highly expressed, growthrelated genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Arabidopsis thaliana, the family of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) is composed of 20 members. Previous studies indicate that plant CNGCs are involved in the control of growth processes and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. According to their proposed function as cation entry pathways these channels contribute to cellular cation homeostasis, including calcium and sodium, as well as to stress-related signal transduction. Here, we studied the expression patterns and regulation of CNGC19 and CNGC20, which constitute one of the five CNGC subfamilies.
RESULTS: GUS, GFP and luciferase reporter assays were used to study the expression of CNGC19 and CNGC20 genes from Arabidopsis thaliana in response to developmental cues and salt stress. CNGC19 and CNGC20 were differentially expressed in roots and shoots. The CNGC19 gene was predominantly active in roots already at early growth stages. Major expression was observed in the phloem. CNGC20 showed highest promoter activity in mesophyll cells surrounding the veins. Its expression increased during development and was maximal in mature and senescent leaves. Both genes were upregulated in the shoot in response to elevated NaCl but not mannitol concentrations. While in the root, CNGC19 did not respond to changes in the salt concentration, in the shoot it was strongly upregulated in the observed time frame (6-72 hours). Salt-induction of CNGC20 was also observed in the shoot, starting already one hour after stress treatment. It occurred with similar kinetics, irrespective of whether NaCl was applied to roots of intact plants or to the petiole of detached leaves. No differences in K and Na contents of the shoots were measured in homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for CNGC19 and CNGC20, respectively, which developed a growth phenotype in the presence of up to 75 mM NaCl similar to that of the wild type.
CONCLUSION: Together, the results strongly suggest that both channels are involved in the salinity response of different cell types in the shoot. Upon salinity both genes are upregulated within hours. CNGC19 and CNGC20 could assist the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress, probably by contributing to a re-allocation of sodium within the plant.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a complex and dynamic process that plays a vital role in plant growth and development. A key component in the regulation of genes is transcription factors (TFs), which coordinate the transcriptional control of gene activity. A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of regulatory interactions between TFs and their target genes. The accurate delineation of GRNs offers a significant contribution to our understanding about how plant cells are organized and function, and how individual genes are regulated in various conditions, organs or cell types. During the past decade, important progress has been made in the identification of GRNs using experimental and computational approaches. However, a detailed overview of available platforms supporting the analysis of GRNs in plants is missing. Here, we review current databases, platforms and tools that perform data-driven analyses of gene regulation in Arabidopsis. The platforms are categorized into two sections, 1) promoter motif analysis tools that use motif mapping approaches to find TF motifs in the regulatory sequences of genes of interest and 2) network analysis tools that identify potential regulators for a set of input genes using a range of data types in order to generate GRNs. We discuss the diverse datasets integrated and highlight the strengths and caveats of different platforms. Finally, we shed light on the limitations of the above approaches and discuss future perspectives, including the need for integrative approaches to unravel complex GRNs in plants.},

  abstract = {Major depression, a debilitating psychiatric disorder, is predicted to be the second most prevalent human illness by the year 2020. Various antidepressants, ranging from monoamine oxidase inhibitors to recently developed dual reuptake inhibitors, are prescribed for alleviating the symptoms of depression. Despite the availability of these blockbuster molecules, approximately 30\% of depressed patients do not respond to the existing drug therapies and the remaining 70\% fails to achieve complete remission. Moreover, antidepressants are associated with a plethora of side effects and drug-drug/drug-food interactions. In this context, novel approaches are being tried to find more efficacious and safer drugs for the treatment of major depression. Curcumin is one such molecule that has shown promising efficacy in various animal models of major depression. Although the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of curcumin is not fully understood, it is hypothesized to act through inhibiting the monoamine oxidase enzyme and modulating the release of serotonin and dopamine. Moreover, evidences have shown that curcumin enhances neurogenesis, notably in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions of the brain. The use of curcumin in clinics for the treatment of major depression is limited due to its poor gastrointestinal absorption. The present review attempts to discuss the pharmacological profile along with molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of curcumin in animal models of depression. A need for clinical trials in order to explore the antidepressant efficacy and safety profile of curcumin is emphasized.},

  abstract = {Transcription initiation, essential to gene expression regulation, involves recruitment of basal transcription factors to the core promoter elements (CPEs). The distribution of currently known CPEs across plant genomes is largely unknown. This is the first large scale genome-wide report on the computational prediction of CPEs across eight plant genomes to help better understand the transcription initiation complex assembly. The distribution of thirteen known CPEs across four monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays) and four dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Glycine max) reveals the structural organization of the core promoter in relation to the TATA-box as well as with respect to other CPEs. The distribution of known CPE motifs with respect to transcription start site (TSS) exhibited positional conservation within monocots and dicots with slight differences across all eight genomes. Further, a more refined subset of annotated genes based on orthologs of the model monocot (O. sativa ssp. japonica) and dicot (A. thaliana) genomes supported the positional distribution of these thirteen known CPEs. DNA free energy profiles provided evidence that the structural properties of promoter regions are distinctly different from that of the non-regulatory genome sequence. It also showed that monocot core promoters have lower DNA free energy than dicot core promoters. The comparison of monocot and dicot promoter sequences highlights both the similarities and differences in the core promoter architecture irrespective of the species-specific nucleotide bias. This study will be useful for future work related to genome annotation projects and can inspire research efforts aimed to better understand regulatory mechanisms of transcription.},

  abstract = {Plants adapt to alterations in light conditions by controlling their gene expression profiles. Expression of light-inducible genes is transcriptionally induced by transcription factors such as HY5. However, few detailed analyses have been carried out on the control of transcription start sites (TSSs). Of the various wavelengths of light, it is blue light (BL) that regulates physiological responses such as hypocotyl elongation and flowering time. To understand how gene expression is controlled not only by transcript abundance but also by TSS selection, we examined genome-wide TSS profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings after exposure to BL irradiation following initial growth in the dark. Thousands of genes use multiple TSSs, and some transcripts have upstream ORFs (uORFs) that take precedence over the main ORF (mORF) encoding proteins. The uORFs often function as translation inhibitors of the mORF or as triggers of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Transcription from TSSs located downstream of the uORFs in 220 genes is enhanced by BL exposure. This type of regulation is found in HY5 and HYH, major regulators of light-dependent gene expression. Translation efficiencies of the genes showing enhanced usage of these TSSs increased upon BL exposure. We also show that transcripts from TSSs upstream of uORFs in 45 of the 220 genes, including HY5, accumulated in a mutant of NMD. These results suggest that BL controls gene expression not only by enhancing transcriptions but also by choosing the TSS, and transcripts from downstream TSSs evade uORF-mediated inhibition to ensure high expression of light-regulated genes.},

They recognize specific DNA sequences, the TF binding sites (TFBSs), and thus are targeted to specific regions of the genome where they can recruit transcriptional co-factors and/or chromatin regulators to fine-tune spatiotemporal gene regulation. Therefore, the identification of TFBSs in genomic sequences and their subsequent quantitative modeling is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting gene expression. Here, we review how TFBSs can be determined experimentally, how the TFBS models can be constructed in silico, and how they can be optimized by taking into account features such as position interdependence within TFBSs, DNA shape, and/or by introducing state-of-the-art computational algorithms such as deep learning methods. In addition, we discuss the integration of context variables into the TFBS modeling, including nucleosome positioning, chromatin states, methylation patterns, 3D genome architectures, and TF cooperative binding, in order to better predict TF binding under cellular contexts. Finally, we explore the possibilities of combining the optimized TFBS model with technological advances, such as targeted TFBS perturbation by CRISPR, to better understand gene regulation, evolution, and plant diversity.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks in understanding genomics is the problem of predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). With more than hundreds of Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS prediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two major biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding patterns on genomes known as "motifs" and (2) interactions among TFs known as co-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Prototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN model automatically extracts prototypes ("motif"-like features) for each TF through a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching models, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with \$2.1\$ \$million\$ genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers TF-TF interactions for large-scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.},

While CRISPR/Cas9 appears to work universally, the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis and the adverse generation of off-target mutations vary greatly between different organisms. In this study, we report that Arabidopsis plants subjected to heat stress at 37°C show much higher frequencies of CRISPR-induced mutations compared to plants grown continuously at the standard temperature (22°C). Using quantitative assays relying on green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes, we found that targeted mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 in Arabidopsis is increased by approximately 5-fold in somatic tissues and up to 100-fold in the germline upon heat treatment. This effect of temperature on the mutation rate is not limited to Arabidopsis, as we observed a similar increase in targeted mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 in Citrus plants exposed to heat stress at 37°C. In vitro assays demonstrate that Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is more active in creating double-stranded DNA breaks at 37°C than at 22°C, thus indicating a potential contributing mechanism for the in vivo effect of temperature on CRISPR/Cas9. This study reveals the importance of temperature in modulating SpCas9 activity in eukaryotes, and provides a simple method to increase on-target mutagenesis in plants using CRISPR/Cas9.},

  abstract = {Regulatory DNAs serve as templates to bring weakly interacting transcription factors into close proximity so they can work synergistically to switch genes on and off in time and space. Most of these regulatory DNAs are enhancers that can work over long distances — a million base pairs or more in mammals — to control gene expression. Critical enhancers are sometimes even found within the introns of neighboring genes. This review summarizes well-defined examples of enhancers controlling key processes in animal development. Potential mechanisms of transcriptional synergy are discussed with regard to enhancer structure and contemporary ChIP-sequencing assays, whereby just a small fraction of the observed binding sites represent bona fide regulatory DNAs. Finally, there is a discussion of how enhancer evolution can produce novelty in animal morphology and of the prospects for reconstructing transitions in animal evolution by introducing derived enhancers in basal ancestors.},

  abstract = {Cell walls are a distinguishing characteristic of plants essential to their survival. The pectin content of primary cell walls in grasses and dicots is distinctly different. Polygalacturonases (PGs) can degrade pectins and participate in multiple developmental processes of plants. This study comprehensively compared the evolution, expression, and cis-regulatory element of PGs in grasses and dicots. A total of 577 PGs identified from five grasses and five dicots fell into seven clades. Evolutionary analysis demonstrated the distinct differences between grasses and dicots in patterns of gene duplication and loss, and evolutionary rates. Grasses generally contained much fewer clade C and F members than dicots. We found that this disparity was the result of less duplication and more gene losses in grasses. More duplications occurred in clades D and E, and expression analysis showed that most of clade E members were expressed ubiquitously at a high overall level and clade D members were closely related to male reproduction in both grasses and dicots, suggesting their biological functions were highly conserved across species. In addition to the general role in reproductive development, PGs of clades C and F specifically played roles in root development in dicots, shedding light on organ differentiation between the two groups of plants. A regulatory element analysis of clade C and F members implied that possible functions of PGs in specific biological responses contributed to their expansion and preservation. This work can improve the knowledge of PGs in plants generally and in grasses specifically and is beneficial to functional studies.},

  abstract = {That regulatory evolution is important in generating phenotypic diversity was suggested soon after the discovery of gene regulation. In the past few decades, studies in animals have provided a number of examples in which phenotypic changes can be traced back to specific alterations in transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and functional genomics have stimulated a new wave of investigation in simple model organisms. In particular, several genome-wide comparative analyses of transcriptional circuits across different yeast species have been performed. These studies have revealed that transcription networks are remarkably plastic: large scale rewiring in which target genes move in and out of regulons through changes in cis-regulatory sequences appears to be a general phenomenon. Transcription factor substitution and the formation of new combinatorial interactions are also important contributors to the rewiring. In several cases, a transition through intermediates with redundant regulatory programs has been suggested as a mechanism through which rewiring can occur without a loss in fitness. Because the basic features of transcriptional regulation are deeply conserved, we speculate that large scale rewiring may underlie the evolution of complex phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms; if so, such rewiring may leave traceable changes in the genome from which the genetic basis of functional innovation can be detected.},

To avoid unfavorable conditions, plants have evolved safeguard mechanisms for seed germination. Here, we report a novel function of the Arabidopsis MADS-box transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 (ANR1) in seed germination. ANR1 knockout mutant is insensitive to ABA, salt, and osmotic stress during the seed germination and early seedling development stages, whereas ANR1-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive. ANR1 is responsive to ABA and abiotic stresses and upregulates the expression of ABI3 to suppress seed germination. ANR1 and ABI3 have similar expression pattern during seed germination. Genetically, ABI3 acts downstream of ANR1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays showed that ANR1 could bind to the ABI3 promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, ANR1 acts synergistically with AGL21 to suppress seed germination in response to ABA as evidenced by anr1 agl21 double mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the ANR1 plays an important role in regulating seed germination and early post-germination growth. ANR1 and AGL21 together constitutes a safeguard mechanism for seed germination to avoid unfavorable conditions.},

However, it can only map the probable protein–DNA interaction loci within 1–2 kilobases resolution. To pinpoint interaction sites down to the base-pair level, we introduce a computational method, Motif Discovery scan (MDscan), that examines the ChIP–array-selected sequences and searches for DNA sequence motifs representing the protein–DNA interaction sites. MDscan combines the advantages of two widely adopted motif search strategies, word enumeration1,2,3,4 and position-specific weight matrix updating5,6,7,8,9, and incorporates the ChIP–array ranking information to accelerate searches and enhance their success rates. MDscan correctly identified all the experimentally verified motifs from published ChIP–array experiments in yeast10,11,12,13 (STE12, GAL4, RAP1, SCB, MCB, MCM1, SFF, and SWI5), and predicted two motif patterns for the differential binding of Rap1 protein in telomere regions. In our studies, the method was faster and more accurate than several established motif-finding algorithms5,8,9. MDscan can be used to find DNA motifs not only in ChIP–array experiments but also in other experiments in which a subgroup of the sequences can be inferred to contain relatively abundant motif sites.

The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations.

However, it remains unknown whether lncRNAs can respond to nitrate or function in nitrate regulation. We detected 695 lncRNAs, 480 known and 215 novel, in Arabidopsis seedling roots; six showed altered expression in response to nitrate treatment, among which T5120 showed the highest induction. Overexpression of T5120 in Arabidopsis promoted the response to nitrate, enhanced nitrate assimilation and improved biomass and root development. Biochemical and molecular analyses revealed that NLP7, a master nitrate regulatory transcription factor, directly bound to the nitrate-responsive cis-element (NRE)-like motif of the T5120 promoter and activated T5120 transcription. In addition, T5120 partially restored the nitrate signalling and assimilation phenotypes of nlp7 mutant, suggesting that T5120 is involved in NLP7-mediated nitrate regulation. Interestingly, the expression of T5120 was regulated by the nitrate sensor NRT1.1. Therefore, T5120 is modulated by NLP7 and NRT1.1 to regulate nitrate signalling. Our work reveals a new regulatory mechanism in which lncRNA T5120 functions in nitrate regulation, providing new insights into the nitrate signalling network. Importantly, lncRNA T5120 can promote nitrate assimilation and plant growth to improve nitrogen use efficiency.},

  abstract = {Seed weight (SW), which is one of the three major factors influencing grain yield, has been widely accepted as a complex trait that is controlled by polygenes, particularly in polyploid crops. Brassica napus L., which is the second leading crop source for vegetable oil around the world, is a tetraploid (4×) species. In the present study, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome A9 of rapeseed in which the genes for SW and silique length (SL) were colocated. By fine mapping and association analysis, we uncovered a 165-bp deletion in the auxin-response factor 18 (ARF18) gene associated with increased SW and SL. ARF18 encodes an auxin-response factor and shows inhibitory activity on downstream auxin genes. This 55-aa deletion prevents ARF18 from forming homodimers, in turn resulting in the loss of binding activity. Furthermore, reciprocal crossing has shown that this QTL affects SW by maternal effects. Transcription analysis has shown that ARF18 regulates cell growth in the silique wall by acting via an auxin-response pathway. Together, our results suggest that ARF18 regulates silique wall development and determines SW via maternal regulation. In addition, our study reveals the first (to our knowledge) QTL in rapeseed and may provide insights into gene cloning involving polyploid crops.},

  abstract = {Synthetic promoters and transcription factors (TFs) have become incredibly powerful and efficient components for precise regulation of targeted plant transgene expression. Synthetic promoters can be rationally designed and constructed using specific type, copy number and spacing of motifs placed upstream of synthetic or native core promoters. Similarly, synthetic TFs can be constructed using a variety of DNA binding domains (DBDs) and effector domains. Synthetic promoters and TFs can provide tremendous advantages over their natural counterparts with regards to transgene expression strength and specificity. They will probably be needed for coordinated transgene expression for metabolic engineering and synthetic circuit applications in plants for bioenergy and advanced crop engineering. In this article we review the recent advances in synthetic promoters and TFs in plants and speculate on their future.},

However, map-based cloning can be time-consuming or even hampered due to low chromosomal recombination. Current strategies using next generation sequencing for molecular identification of mutations require whole genome sequencing and advanced computational devises and skills, which are not readily accessible or affordable to every laboratory. We have developed a streamlined method using parallel massive sequencing for mutant identification in which only targeted regions are sequenced. This targeted parallel sequencing (TPSeq) method is more cost-effective, straightforward enough to be easily done without specialized bioinformatics expertise, and reliable for identifying multiple mutations simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate its use by identifying three novel nitrate-signaling mutants in Arabidopsis.},

However, to accommodate a quick screen plasmid construction and preparation can be time consuming. Here we report a PCR amplified dsDNA fragments (PCR-fragments) based transient expression system (PCR-TES) for suiting in the study of gene regulation in plant cells. Instead of transforming plasmids into plant cells, transient expression of PCR-fragments can be applicable. The transformation efficiency and expression property of PCR-fragments are comparable to transformation using plasmids. We analyzed the transformation efficiency in PCR-TES at transcription and protein levels. Our results indicate that the PCR-TES is as versatile as the conventional transformation system using plasmid DNA. Through reconstituting PYR1-mediated ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, we were not only validating the practicality of PCR-TES but also screening potential candidates of CDPK family members which might be involved in the ABA signaling. Moreover, we determined that phosphorylation of ABF2 by CPK4 could be mediated by ABA-induced PYR1 and ABI1, demonstrating a crucial role of CDPKs in the ABA signaling. In summary, PCR-TES can be applicable to facilitate analyzing gene regulation and for the screen of putative regulatory molecules at the high throughput level in plant cells.},

The resulting collection of functional synTF/synP pairs confers very low background expression under uninduced conditions, while expression output upon induction of the various synTFs covers a wide range and reaches induction factors of up to 400. The broad spectrum of expression strengths that is achieved will be useful for various experimental setups, e.g., the transcriptional balancing of expression levels within heterologous pathways or the construction of artificial regulatory networks. Furthermore, our analyses reveal simple rules that enable the tuning of synTF expression output, thereby allowing easy modification of a given synTF/synP pair. This will make it easier for researchers to construct tailored transcriptional control systems.},

It is unclear how many cis-regulatory elements exist, where these elements lie relative to promoters, and how these features are conserved across plant species. We employed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) in four plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Solanum lycopersicum, and Oryza sativa) to delineate open chromatin regions and transcription factor (TF) binding sites across each genome. Despite 10-fold variation in intergenic space among species, the majority of open chromatin regions lie within 3 kb upstream of a transcription start site in all species. We find a common set of four TFs that appear to regulate conserved gene sets in the root tips of all four species, suggesting that TF-gene networks are generally conserved. Comparative ATAC-seq profiling of Arabidopsis root hair and non-hair cell types revealed extensive similarity as well as many cell-type-specific differences. Analyzing TF binding sites in differentially accessible regions identified a MYB-driven regulatory module unique to the hair cell, which appears to control both cell fate regulators and abiotic stress responses. Our analyses revealed common regulatory principles among species and shed light on the mechanisms producing cell-type-specific transcriptomes during development.},

We previously reported a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas, which we named ROS-map, that revealed ROS-responsible genes in Arabidopsis root tips. By using ROS-map, we have characterised an early ROS response key transcription factor, MYB30, as a regulator of root cell elongation under ROS signals. However, there are other ROS-responsible transcription factors which have the potential to regulate root growth. In the present study, we characterised the function of another early ROS-responsible transcription factor, ANAC032, that was selected from ROS-map. Overexpression of ANAC032 fused with the transcriptional activation domain, VP16, inhibited root growth, especially decreasing cell elongation. By transcriptome analysis, we revealed that ANAC032 regulated many stress-responsible genes in the roots. Intriguingly, ANAC032 upregulated MYB30 and its target genes. The upregulation of MYB30 target genes was completely abolished in the ANAC032-VP16x2 OX and ANAC032 estradiol-inducible line in myb30-2 mutants. Moreover, root growth inhibition was alleviated in ANAC032-OX in myb30-2 mutants. Overall, we characterised an upstream transcription factor, ANAC032, of the MYB30 transcriptional cascade which is a key regulator for root cell elongation under ROS signalling.},

The process relies on the use of sequence specific nucleases (SSNs) to make DNA double stranded breaks at user defined genomic loci, which are subsequently repaired by two main DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR). NHEJ can result in frameshift mutations that often create genetic knockouts. These knockout lines are useful for functional and reverse genetic studies but also have applications in agriculture. HDR has a variety of applications as it can be used for gene replacement, gene stacking, and for creating various fusion proteins. In recent years, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated protein 9 or CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1 have emerged as the preferred SSNs for research purposes.

Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x's and m y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner.

Although genome location strongly affected CRS activity, the relative strengths of CRSs were maintained at all chromosomal locations. The intrinsic activities of CRSs also correlated with their activities in plasmid-based assays. We explain our data with a quantitative model in which expression levels are set by independent contributions from local CRSs and the regional chromatin environment, rather than by more complex sequence- or protein-specific interactions between these two factors. The methods we present will help investigators determine when regulatory information is integrated in a modular fashion and when regulatory sequences interact in more complex ways.},

  abstract = {Genome expansion is believed to be an important driver of the evolution of gene regulation. To investigate the role of a newly arising sequence in rewiring regulatory networks, we estimated the age of each region of the human genome by applying maximum parsimony to genome-wide alignments with 100 vertebrates. We then studied the age distribution of several types of functional regions, with a focus on regulatory elements. The age distribution of regulatory elements reveals the extensive use of newly formed genomic sequence in the evolution of regulatory interactions. Many transcription factors have expanded their repertoire of targets through waves of genomic expansions that can be traced to specific evolutionary times. Repeated elements contributed a major part of such expansion: many classes of such elements are enriched in binding sites of one or a few specific transcription factors, whose binding sites are localized in specific portions of the element and characterized by distinctive motif words. These features suggest that the binding sites were available as soon as the new sequence entered the genome, rather than being created later by accumulation of point mutations. By comparing the age of regulatory regions to the evolutionary shift in expression of nearby genes, we show that rewiring through genome expansion played an important role in shaping human regulatory networks.},

Thirty-two subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg of 5-HTP or placebo with the CCK-4 challenge following in 90 min in a double-blind, parallel-group design. The results showed a nonsignificant difference between the groups in panic rate (19\% after 5-HTP and 44\% after placebo, p = 0.13) with a trend for lower intensity of symptoms after 5-HTP (p = 0.08). Further analysis by gender revealed that females in the 5-HTP group had a significantly lower panic rate and intensity of cognitive symptoms whereas, in males, the effect of 5-HTP was limited to lowering the intensity of somatic panic symptoms. Thus, an increased availability of 5-HT may have a gender-dependent protective effect in CCK-4-induced panic.},

To elucidate the role of chromosomal structure in this regulatory phenomenon we have investigated the DNase I sensitivity and methylation status of the kappa locus and selected V kappa genes in a variety of alleles exhibiting different rearrangement configurations and different levels of transcriptional activity. Our findings indicate that the kappa locus in either germline or rearranged contexts maintains a distinctive DNase I-sensitive, hypomethylated structure in plasmacytomas and hybridomas, irrespective of its level of transcriptional activity. In contrast, the germline V kappa genes are in less accessible regions of chromatin and more highly methylated regions of DNA. Upon fusion to the kappa locus, V kappa genes become DNase I-sensitive and hypomethylated. This effect extends several kilobases upstream of the transcriptional initiation site but does not extend to the adjacent V kappa gene or to the identical V kappa allele on the other chromosome, indicating that the structural alteration is a localized cis-acting phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Transcription initiates at both coding and noncoding genomic elements, including mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has a different expression profile with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than nondivergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue specificity is strongly associated with having less complex transcription factor (TF) motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity. Moreover, we find that 22\% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.},

  abstract = {We employ real-time PCR to allow us to quantify the sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by DNaseI. This approach has three clear advantages over the more conventional use of the Southern hybridization assay: the accuracy of quantification is improved; the resolution of the assay is enhanced, by designing primers to amplify small amplicons it is possible to analyze sequences both co-incident and proximal to sites of DNaseI-hypersensitivity; less material is needed, as little as 5 ng of treated genomic DNA. We applied this method in an analysis of the chromatin structure of the previously described mouse β-globin locus control region (LCR) using fetal liver cells. The four hypersensitive sites of the canonical mouse LCR, HS1 to HS4, are shown to have kinetics of digestion consistent with these sequences being nucleosome-free in vivo. A different pattern was seen for HS6, a recently described “weak” hypersensitive site. The site was also rapidly lost but more of the sites proved resistant, we interpreted this to show that this hypersensitive was only forming in a portion of the erythroid cells. This finding implies that in vivo the LCR is structurally heterogeneous. Sequences proximal to the hypersensitive sites show a third pattern of intermediate sensitivity, consistent with the chromatin being unfolded but the sites still bound by a continual nucleosomal array. Our results demonstrate that this method has the potential to achieve accurate and detailed mapping of chromatin structure from small amounts of tissue samples.},

There are two strands in the asymmetric unit, and these coil about each other to form a right-handed double-helix of the A-type with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds between base-pairs. The helix has a shallow minor groove and a deep, water-filled major groove; almost all exposed functional groups on the DNA are hydrated, and 106 ordered solvent molecules have been found. The two d(G-G-G-G) · d(C-C-C-C) segments in the octamer exhibit similar and uniform structures, but there is a slight discontinuity at the GpC step between them. A recurring feature of the structure is the overlap of adjacent guanine bases in each GpG step, with the five-membered ring of one guanine stacking on the six-membered ring of its neighbour. There is little or no overlap between adjacent cytosine rings. Conformational parameters for these GpG steps are compared with those from other single-crystal X-ray analyses. In general, GpG steps exhibit high slide, low roll and variable twist. Models for poly(dG) · poly(dC) were generated by applying a simple rotation and translation to each of the unmodified d(G-G-G-G) · d(C-C-C-C) units. Detailed features of these models are shown to be compatible with various assays of poly(dG) · poly(dC) in solution, and are useful in understanding the polymorphic behaviour of this sequence under a variety of experimental conditions.},

Such a diet must include an adequate intake of micronutrients, essential fatty acids, amino acids and antioxidants. The monoamine neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, are derived from dietary amino acids and are involved in the modulation of mood, anxiety, cognition, sleep regulation and appetite. The capacity of nutritional interventions to elevate brain monoamine concentrations and, as a consequence, with the potential for mood enhancement, has not been extensively evaluated. The present study investigated an extract from oregano leaves, with a specified range of active constituents, identified via an unbiased, high-throughput screening programme. The oregano extract was demonstrated to inhibit the reuptake and degradation of the monoamine neurotransmitters in a dose-dependent manner, and microdialysis experiments in rats revealed an elevation of extracellular serotonin levels in the brain. Furthermore, following administration of oregano extract, behavioural responses were observed in mice that parallel the beneficial effects exhibited by monoamine-enhancing compounds when used in human subjects. In conclusion, these data show that an extract prepared from leaves of oregano, a major constituent of the Mediterranean diet, is brain-active, with moderate triple reuptake inhibitory activity, and exhibits positive behavioural effects in animal models. We postulate that such an extract may be effective in enhancing mental well-being in humans.},

  abstract = {RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) regulatory cascades involving transcription factors (TFs) and their targets orchestrate the genetic circuitry of every eukaryotic organism. In order to understand how these cascades function, they can be dissected into small genetic networks, each containing just a few Pol II transcribed genes, that generate specific signal-processing outcomes. Small RNA regulatory circuits involve direct regulation of a small RNA by a TF and/or direct regulation of a TF by a small RNA and have been shown to play unique roles in many organisms. Here, we will focus on small RNA regulatory circuits containing Pol II transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs). While the role of miRNA-containing regulatory circuits as modular building blocks for the function of complex networks has long been on the forefront of studies in the animal kingdom, plant studies are poised to take a lead role in this area because of their advantages in probing transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of Pol II genes. The relative simplicity of tissue-and cell-type organization, miRNA targeting, and genomic structure make the Arabidopsis thaliana plant model uniquely amenable for small RNA regulatory circuit studies in a multicellular organism. In this Review, we cover analysis, tools, and validation methods for probing the component interactions in miRNA-containing regulatory circuits. We then review the important roles that plant miRNAs are playing in these circuits and summarize methods for the identification of small genetic circuits that strongly influence plant function. We conclude by noting areas of opportunity where new plant studies are imminently needed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Seminal studies in vertebrate protein evolution concluded that gene regulatory changes likely drive anatomical innovations. Even in the unparalleled East African cichlid fish radiation, we demonstrate cis-regulatory divergence as a contributor to phenotypic diversity. To further investigate this mechanism, we extended the Arboretum algorithm, initially designed for yeast adaptation to study the evolution of regulatory expression divergence in complex vertebrate species. For the first time, we reconstruct tissue-specific gene regulatory networks underpinning evolutionary adaptations from multiple vertebrate species in a phylogeny. Our framework consists of identifying ancestral reconstructed and extant species gene co-expression modules and integrating their associated regulators to investigate gene regulatory network evolution contributing to traits of phenotypic diversity in the East African cichlids. Along the phylogeny, we identify tissue-specific co-expression patterns across six tissues of five cichlids species that were predicted to be regulated by divergent suites of regulators. We report striking cases of rapid network rewiring for adaptive trait genes, such as the visual system. In regulatory regions of visual opsin genes e.g. sws1, in vitro assays confirm that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) have driven network rewiring between species sharing the same visual palette. SNPs overlapping TFBSs segregate according to phylogeny and ecology suggesting ecotype-associated network rewiring in East African cichlid radiations. Our unique integrative approach inferring multi-species regulatory networks allowed us to identify regulatory changes associated with traits of phenotypic diversity in radiating cichlids.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Seminal studies of vertebrate protein evolution speculated that gene regulatory changes can drive anatomical innovations. However, very little is still known about gene regulatory network (GRN) evolution associated with phenotypic effect across ecologically-diverse species. Using a novel approach to reconstruct GRNs in vertebrate species, we aimed to study GRN evolution in representative species of the most striking example of an adaptive radiation, the East African cichlids. We previously demonstrated how the explosive phenotypic diversification of East African cichlids is attributed to diverse molecular mechanisms, including accelerated regulatory sequence evolution and gene expression divergence. To investigate these mechanisms across species at a genome-wide scale, our novel network-based approach identifies ancestral and extant gene co-expression modules along a phylogeny, and by integrating associated regulators, predicts candidate regulatory regions implicated in traits under selection in cichlids. As a case study, we present data from a well-studied adaptive trait - the visual system - for which we report striking cases of network rewiring for visual opsin genes, identify discrete regulatory variants, and investigate the plausibility of their association with cichlid visual system evolution. In regulatory regions of visual opsin genes, in vitro assays confirm that transcription factor binding site mutations disrupt regulatory edges across species, and segregate according to lake species phylogeny and ecology, suggesting GRN rewiring in radiating cichlids. Our approach revealed numerous novel potential candidate regulatory regions across cichlid genomes with no prior association, as well as those with previously reported associations to known adaptive evolutionary traits, thus providing proof of concept.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Re-addition of nitrate to starved plants rapidly re-programs the metabolism and gene expression, but the earliest responses to nitrogen deprivation are unknown. Here, the early transcriptional and (phospho)proteomic responses of roots to nitrate or ammonium deprivation were analyzed. The rapid transcriptional repression of known nitrate-induced genes proceeded the tissue NO3− concentration drop, with the transcription factor genes LBD37/38 and HRS1/HHO1 among those with earliest significant change. Similar rapid transcriptional repression occurred in loss-of-function mutants of the nitrate response factor NLP7 and some transcripts were stabilized by nitrate. In contrast, an early transcriptional response to ammonium deprivation was almost completely absent. However, ammonium deprivation induced a rapid and transient perturbation of the proteome and a differential phosphorylation pattern in proteins involved in adjusting the pH and cation homeostasis, plasma membrane H+, NH4+, K+ and water fluxes. Fewer differential phosphorylation patterns in transporters, kinases and other proteins occurred with nitrate deprivation. The deprivation responses were not just opposite to the re-supply responses, but identified NO3− deprivation-induced mRNA decay and signaling candidates potentially reporting the external nitrate status to the cell.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental molecular mechanism involved in almost every aspect of life, from homeostasis to development, from metabolism to behavior, from reaction to stimuli to disease progression. In recent years, the concept of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) has grown popular as an effective applied biology approach for describing the complex and highly dynamic set of transcriptional interactions, due to its easy-to-interpret features. Since cataloguing, predicting and understanding every GRN connection in all species and cellular contexts remains a great challenge for biology, researchers have developed numerous tools and methods to infer regulatory processes. In this review, we catalogue these methods in six major areas, based on the dominant underlying information leveraged to infer GRNs: Coexpression, Sequence Motifs, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Orthology, Literature and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) specifically focused on transcriptional complexes. The methods described here cover a wide range of user-friendliness: from web tools that require no prior computational expertise to command line programs and algorithms for large scale GRN inferences. Each method for GRN inference described herein effectively illustrates a type of transcriptional relationship, with many methods being complementary to others. While a truly holistic approach for inferring and displaying GRNs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of systems biology, we believe that the integration of multiple methods described herein provides an effective means with which experimental and computational biologists alike may obtain the most complete pictures of transcriptional relationships.

  abstract = {Background
Core promoters are the gene regulatory regions most proximal to the transcription start site (TSS), central to the formation of pre-initiation complexes and for combinatorial gene regulation. The DNA elements required for core promoter function in plants are poorly understood. To establish the sequence motifs that characterize plant core promoters and to compare them to the corresponding sequences in animals, we took advantage of available full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) and predicted upstream regulatory sequences to carry out the analysis of 12,749 Arabidopsis core promoters.

Results
Using a combination of expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling methods, we identified several motifs overrepresented in Arabidopsis core promoters. One of them corresponded to the TATA element, for which an in-depth analysis resulted in the generation of robust TATA Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFMs) capable of predicting Arabidopsis TATA elements with a high degree of confidence. We established that approximately 29\% of all Arabidopsis promoters contain TATA motifs, clustered around position -32 with respect to the TSS. The presence of TATA elements was associated with genes represented more frequently in EST collections and with shorter 5' UTRs. No cis-elements were found over-represented in TATA-less, compared to TATA-containing promoters.

Conclusion
Our studies provide a first genome-wide illustration of the composition and structure of core Arabidopsis promoters. The percentage of TATA-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized, yet comparable to the number of Drosophila promoters containing a TATA element. Although several other DNA elements were identified as over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters, they are present in only a small fraction of the genes and they represent elements not previously described in animals, suggesting a distinct architecture of the core promoters of plant and animal genes.},

Emerging evidence suggests that it regulates gene expression in cis or trans by modulating the chromatin structure. To uncover the functional role of ncRNA in chromatin organization, we deep sequenced chromatin-associated RNAs (CARs) from human fibroblast (HF) cells. This resulted in the identification of 141 intronic regions and 74 intergenic regions harboring CARs. The intronic and intergenic CARs show significant conservation across 44 species of placental mammals. Functional characterization of one of the intergenic CARs, Intergenic10, revealed that it regulates gene expression of neighboring genes through modulating the chromatin structure in cis. Our data suggest that ncRNA is an integral component of chromatin and that it may regulate various biological functions through fine-tuning of the chromatin architecture.},

Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples. Using this data set, we grouped TSS reads into “TSS tag clusters” and categorized clusters into three spatial initiation patterns: narrow peak, broad with peak, and weak peak. We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad “TATA-less” promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements. We present results on the usage of these elements and provide our Plant PEAT Peaks (3PEAT) model that predicts the presence of TSSs directly from sequence.},

One hundred and forty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of three independent groups, and subsequently performed the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized cognitive assessment battery in a cubicle containing either one of the two odors or no odor (control). Visual analogue mood questionnaires were completed prior to exposure to the odor, and subsequently after completion of the test battery. The participants were deceived as to the genuine aim of the study until the completion of testing to prevent expectancy effects from possibly influencing the data. The outcome variables from the nine tasks that constitute the CDR core battery feed into six factors that represent different aspects of cognitive functioning. Analysis of performance revealed that lavender produced a significant decrement in performance of working memory, and impaired reaction times for both memory and attention based tasks compared to controls. In contrast, rosemary produced a significant enhancement of performance for overall quality of memory and secondary memory factors, but also produced an impairment of speed of memory compared to controls. With regard to mood, comparisons of the change in ratings from baseline to post-test revealed that following the completion of the cognitive assessment battery, both the control and lavender groups were significantly less alert than the rosemary condition; however, the control group was significantly less content than both rosemary and lavender conditions. These findings indicate that the olfactory properties of these essential oils can produce objective effects on cognitive performance, as well as subjective effects on mood.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important essential macro-elements for plant growth and development, and nitrate represents the most abundant inorganic form of N in soils. The nitrate uptake and assimilation processes are finely tuned according to the available nitrate in the surroundings as well as by the internal finely coordinated signaling pathways. The NIN-like proteins (NLPs) harbor both RWP-RK, and Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domains, and they belong to the well-characterized plant-specific RWP-RK transcription factor gene family. NLPs are known to be involved in the nitrate signaling pathway by activating downstream target genes, and thus they are implicated in the primary nitrate response in the nucleus via their RWP-RK domains. The PB1 domain is a ubiquitous protein–protein interaction domain and it comprises another regulatory layer for NLPs via the protein interactions within NLPs or with other essential components. Recently, Ca2+–Ca2+ sensor protein kinase–NLP signaling cascades have been identified and they allow NLPs to have central roles in mediating the nitrate signaling pathway. NLPs play essential roles in many aspects of plant growth and development via the finely tuned nitrate signaling pathway. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the emerging roles played by NLPs in the N starvation response, nodule formation in legumes, N and P interactions, and root cap release in higher plants. In this review, we consider recent advances in the identification, evolution, molecular characteristics, and functions of the NLP gene family in plant growth and development.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic modifications of chromatin serve an important role in regulating the expression and accessibility of genomic DNA. We report here a genomewide approach for fractionating yeast chromatin into two functionally distinct parts, one containing RNA polymerase II transcribed sequences, and the other comprising noncoding sequences and genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III. Noncoding regions could be further fractionated into promoters and segments lacking promoters. The observed separations were apparently based on differential crosslinking efficiency of chromatin in different genomic regions. The results reveal a genomewide molecular mechanism for marking promoters and genomic regions that have a license to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II, a previously unrecognized level of genomic complexity that may exist in all eukaryotes. Our approach has broad potential use as a tool for genome annotation and for the characterization of global changes in chromatin structure that accompany different genetic, environmental, and disease states.},

Twelve female students carried out a word processing task for 40 min. The salivary CgA-like IR increased more than three times on the task, but the salivary cortisol did not change. The increase in the CgA-like IR level was attenuated by the exposure to negative air ions during the task. The exposure to the ions during the recovery period following the task was effective for rapidly decreasing the CgA-like IR level that had increased after the task. These effects by negative air ions were also observed using STAI-S. Task performance was slightly but significantly improved by the presence of negative air ions. These results suggest that negative air ions are effective for the reduction of and the prompt recovery from stress caused by computer operation.},

Gene function studies based on these methods are therefore incomplete. To effect facile manipulation of gene expression across a full continuum of possible expression levels, we recently created a library of mutant promoters. Here, we provide the detailed characterization of our yeast promoter collection comprising 11 mutants of the strong constitutive Saccharomyces cerevisiae TEF1 promoter. The activities of the mutant promoters range between about 8\% and 120\% of the activity of the unmutated TEF1 promoter. The differences in reporter gene expression in the 11 mutants were independent of the carbon source used, and real-time PCR confirmed that these differences were due to varying levels of transcription (i.e., caused by varying promoter strengths). In addition to a CEN/ARS plasmid-based promoter collection, we also created promoter replacement cassettes. They enable genomic integration of our mutant promoter collection upstream of any given yeast gene, allowing detailed genotype-phenotype characterizations. To illustrate the utility of the method, the GPD1 promoter of S. cerevisiae was replaced by five TEF1 promoter mutants of different strengths, which allowed analysis of the impact of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity on the glycerol yield.},

Extensive variation of DNA methylation patterns within a species has been uncovered from studies of natural variation. However, the extent to which DNA methylation varies between flowering plant species is still unclear. To understand the variation in genomic patterning of DNA methylation across flowering plant species, we compared single base resolution DNA methylomes of 34 diverse angiosperm species.
Results: By analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data in a phylogenetic context, it becomes clear that there is extensive variation throughout angiosperms in gene body DNA methylation, euchromatic silencing of transposons and repeats, as well as silencing of heterochromatic transposons. The Brassicaceae have reduced CHG methylation levels and also reduced or loss of CG gene body methylation. The Poaceae are characterized by a lack or reduction of heterochromatic CHH methylation and enrichment of CHH methylation in genic regions. Furthermore, low levels of CHH methylation are observed in a number of species, especially in clonally propagated species.
Conclusions: These results reveal the extent of variation in DNA methylation in angiosperms and show that DNA methylation patterns are broadly a reflection of the evolutionary and life histories of plant species.},

We also recovered strong support for novel relationships among tribes, and resolved the position of 16 taxa previously not assigned to a tribe. The broad utility of these phylogenetic results is illustrated through a comparative investigation of genome-wide expression signatures that distinguish simple from complex leaves in Brassicaceae.

Here we describe a paired-end sequencing strategy, which enables more robust mapping and characterization of capped transcripts. We used this strategy to explore the transcription initiation landscape in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Extending the previous findings in mammals, we found that fly promoters exhibited distinct initiation patterns, which were linked to specific promoter sequence motifs. Furthermore, we identified many 5′ capped transcripts originating from coding exons; our analyses support that they are unlikely the result of alternative TSSs, but rather the product of post-transcriptional modifications. We demonstrated paired-end TSS analysis to be a powerful method to uncover the transcriptional complexity of eukaryotic genomes.},

  abstract = {NAC transcription factors are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants, and members of the NAC gene family have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant stress responses. A phylogenetic analysis of NAC genes, with a focus on rice and Arabidopsis, was performed. Herein, we present an overview of the regulation of the stress responsive NAC SNAC/(IX) group of genes that are implicated in the resistance to different stresses. SNAC factors have important roles for the control of biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance and that their overexpression can improve stress tolerance via biotechnological approaches. We also review the recent progress in elucidating the roles of NAC transcription factors in plant biotic and abiotic stresses. Modification of the expression pattern of transcription factor genes and/or changes in their activity contribute to the elaboration of various signaling pathways and regulatory networks. However, a single NAC gene often responds to several stress factors, and their protein products may participate in the regulation of several seemingly disparate processes as negative or positive regulators. Additionally, the NAC proteins function via auto-regulation or cross-regulation is extensively found among NAC genes. These observations assist in the understanding of the complex mechanisms of signaling and transcriptional reprogramming controlled by NAC proteins.},

  abstract = {While most cells in multicellular organisms carry the same genetic information, in each cell type only a subset of genes is being transcribed. Such differentiation in gene expression depends, for a large part, on the activation and repression of regulatory sequences, including transcriptional enhancers. Transcriptional enhancers can be located tens of kilobases from their target genes, but display characteristic chromatin and DNA features, allowing their identification by genome-wide profiling. Here we show that integration of chromatin characteristics can be applied to predict distal enhancer candidates in Zea mays, thereby providing a basis for a better understanding of gene regulation in this important crop plant.},

Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that {$>$}75\% (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape. DAP-seq datasets also yielded insight into the biology and binding site architecture of numerous TFs, demonstrating the value of DAP-seq for cost-effective cistromic and epicistromic annotation in any organism.,},

  abstract = {Heparanase is an endo-β-glucuronidase that specifically cleaves the saccharide chains of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and releases HS-bound cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive growth-promoting factors. Heparanase plays an important role in the nucleus as part of an active chromatin complex. Our previous studies revealed that rs4693608 correlates with heparanase levels and increased risk of acute and extensive chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Discrepancy between recipient and donor in this SNP significantly affected the risk of acute GVHD. In the present study, we analyzed the HPSE gene region, including rs4693608, and demonstrated that this region exhibits SNPs-dependent enhancer activity. Analysis of nuclear proteins from normal leukocytes revealed their binding to DNA probe of both alleles with higher affinity to allele G. All malignant cell lines and leukemia samples disclosed a shift of the main bands in comparison to normal leukocytes. At least five additional shifted bands were bound to allele A while allele G probe was bound to only one main DNA/protein complex. Additional SNPs rs4693083, rs4693084, and rs4693609 were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs11099592 (exon 7). Only rs4693084 affected protein binding to DNA in cell lines and leukemia samples. As a result of the short distance between rs4693608 and rs4693084, both SNPs may be included in a common DNA/protein complex. DNA pull-down assay revealed that heparanase is involved in self-regulation by negative feedback in rs4693608-dependent manner. During carcinogenesis, heparanase self-regulation is discontinued and the helicase-like transcription factor begins to regulate this enhancer region. Altogether, our study elucidates conceivable mechanism(s) by which rs4693608 SNP regulates HPSE gene expression and the associated disease outcome.},

  abstract = {The snail gene encodes a transcriptional repressor that functions during animal development and in cancer progression to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. Strict spatial and temporal boundaries of Snail expression in development imply precise transcriptional control, which becomes inappropriately activated in many cancer subtypes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism(s) governing transcriptional control of Snail, we analyze chromatin structural changes associated with Snail transcription in melanoma cells. Regardless of transcriptional status, the Snail promoter displays three constitutive DNase hypersensitive sites (HS) and a moderate level of histone H3 Lys(4) dimethylation. A robust HS is found in the 3' region of A375 melanoma cells, in which Snail is highly expressed, but is absent in cells not expressing Snail. This element is conserved throughout the mammalian lineage and strongly activates expression of a reporter in A375 and Colo829 melanoma cells, but not in keratinocytes or primary melanocytes. Activity of this enhancer is associated with enrichment of H3 Lys(4) dimethylation and H3 acetylation at both the enhancer and the promoter. Additionally, enhancer activity is associated with H3 Lys(4) trimethylation at the promoter. A physical interaction between the 3' enhancer and promoter was observed in Snail-expressing cells, demonstrating a direct role for the enhancer in Snail expression. These results suggest a model in which the Snail promoter is constitutively packaged in a poised chromatin structure that can be activated in melanoma cells by a tissue-specific enhancer, which physically contacts the promoter.},

  abstract = {Engineering plant promoter sequence for optimal expression of a gene has been a long standing goal for plant scientists. In recent times, Sequence Specific Nucleases (SSNs) like CRISPR/Cas9 are enabling researchers to achieve this goal, in vivo in the genome. It is well known that SSNs have met with unprecedented success in rapid transgene free crop improvement largely by targeting the coding sequence. Here, we discuss the strategies being employed by plant scientists in targeting SSNs to non-coding promoter regions/Cis Regulatory Elements (CRE). We collectively refer all such endeavors as in vivo promoter engineering (IPE). We further classify the IPE efforts into CRE addition, CRE deletion/disruption, promoter swap/insertion and targeted promoter polymorphism. Till date, IPE has proven useful in altering plant architecture in tomato, developing resistance against Xanthomonas sp in rice and citrus, and engineering drought tolerance in maize. However it is quite challenging to achieve predictable changes in gene expression using IPE at this point. In future years, data generated from high throughput techniques to investigate non coding genome may immensely augment the efforts in this direction. As IPE does not involve addition of the transgene for modifying crop traits, it will be relatively more conducive to public acceptance in crop improvement programs.},

Our genomic analysis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that the number of shared regulatory motifs in the duplicates decreases with evolutionary time, whereas the total number of regulatory motifs remains unchanged. Moreover, genes with numerous paralogs in the yeast genome do not have especially low number of regulatory motifs. These findings indicate that degenerative complementation is not the sole mechanism behind expression divergence in yeast. Moreover, we found some evidence for the action of positive selection on cis-regulatory motifs after gene duplication. These results suggest that the evolution of functional novelty has a substantial role in yeast duplicate gene evolution.},

  abstract = {The dynamic nature of gene regulatory networks allows cells to rapidly respond to environmental change. However, the underlying temporal connections are missed, even in kinetic studies, as transcription factor (TF) binding within at least one time point is required to identify primary targets. The TF-regulated but unbound genes are dismissed as secondary targets. Instead, we report that these genes comprise transient TF–target interactions most relevant to rapid signal transduction. We temporally perturbed a master TF (Basic Leucine Zipper 1, bZIP1) and the nitrogen (N) signal it transduces and integrated TF regulation and binding data from the same cell samples. Our enabling approach could identify primary TF targets based solely on gene regulation, in the absence of TF binding. We uncovered three classes of primary TF targets: (i) poised (TF-bound but not TF-regulated), (ii) stable (TF-bound and TF-regulated), and (iii) transient (TF-regulated but not TF-bound), the largest class. Unexpectedly, the transient bZIP1 targets are uniquely relevant to rapid N signaling in planta, enriched in dynamic N-responsive genes, and regulated by TF and N signal interactions. These transient targets include early N responders nitrate transporter 2.1 and NIN-like protein 3, bound by bZIP1 at 1–5 min, but not at later time points following TF perturbation. Moreover, promoters of these transient targets are uniquely enriched with cis-regulatory motifs coinherited with bZIP1 binding sites, suggesting a recruitment role for bZIP1. This transient mode of TF action supports a classic, but forgotten, “hit-and-run” transcription model, which enables a “catalyst TF” to activate a large set of targets within minutes of signal perturbation.},

  abstract = {All eukaryotic genomes are packaged as chromatin, with DNA interlaced with both regularly patterned nucleosomes and sub-nucleosomal-sized protein structures such as mobile and labile transcription factors (TF) and initiation complexes, together forming a dynamic chromatin landscape. Whilst details of nucleosome position in Arabidopsis have been previously analysed, there is less understanding of their relationship to more dynamic sub-nucleosomal particles (subNSPs) defined as protected regions shorter than the \textasciitilde 150bp typical of nucleosomes. The genome-wide profile of these subNSPs has not been previously analysed in plants and this study investigates the relationship of dynamic bound particles with transcriptional control. Here we combine differential micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and a modified paired-end sequencing protocol to reveal the chromatin structure landscape of Arabidopsis cells across a wide particle size range. Linking this data to RNAseq expression analysis provides detailed insight into the relationship of identified DNA-bound particles with transcriptional activity. The use of differential digestion reveals sensitive positions, including a labile -1 nucleosome positioned upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of active genes. We investigated the response of the chromatin landscape to changes in environmental conditions using light and dark growth, given the large transcriptional changes resulting from this simple alteration. The resulting shifts in the suites of expressed and repressed genes show little correspondence to changes in nucleosome positioning, but led to significant alterations in the profile of subNSPs upstream of TSS both globally and locally. We examined previously mapped positions for the TFs PIF3, PIF4 and CCA1, which regulate light responses, and found that changes in subNSPs co-localized with these binding sites. This small particle structure is detected only under low levels of MNase digestion and is lost on more complete digestion of chromatin to nucleosomes. We conclude that wide-spectrum analysis of the Arabidopsis genome by differential MNase digestion allows detection of sensitive features hereto obscured, and the comparisons between genome-wide subNSP profiles reveals dynamic changes in their distribution, particularly at distinct genomic locations (i.e. 5’UTRs). The method here employed allows insight into the complex influence of genetic and extrinsic factors in modifying the sub-nucleosomal landscape in association with transcriptional changes., DNA is packaged by proteins into chromatin, of which the fundamental unit is a complex of histone proteins that wraps \textasciitilde 150bp of DNA into a nucleosome. Digestion of chromatin with enzymes such as micrococcal nuclease cuts the DNA between the protein particles, and by sequencing the cut sites, they can be mapped across the entire genome. Whilst nucleosomes are the most stable feature, less intensive digestion reveals a wider range of protein particles bound to DNA, in particular small sub-nucleosomal particles located most frequently upstream of genes. Here we show that these techniques can be used in the plant Arabidopsis to map the chromatin landscape of the range of particles sizes across the genome. We show for the first time in a multicellular higher eukaryote that this chromatin landscape is dynamic in response to environmental changes, in this case light or dark growth. Whereas the nucleosome positioning does not change significantly, we show profound changes in the smaller more labile factors under these different conditions. These changes in many cases correspond to the known binding sites of transcription factors that regulate genes in response to light, leading us to propose that full-spectrum chromatin landscape analysis can reveal directly the changes in transcription factor complex binding across the genome.},

Several methods enable the efficient one-step assembly of multiple DNA parts into a suitable plasmid acceptor at high efficiency. Type IIS-mediated assembly offers the specific advantage of a one-step reaction that does not require proprietary reagents or the amplification and purification of linear DNA fragments. Instead, multiple plasmids housing standardized DNA parts of interest are combined in an enzyme cocktail. To make these standard parts, DNA sequences with defined functions are assigned specific sequence features. This allows parts to be interoperable and reusable. The availability of collections of DNA parts and molecular toolkits that allow the facile assembly of multigene binary constructs and the establishment of standards for the creation of new parts means Type IIS-mediated assembly has become a powerful technology for modern plant molecular biologists. © 2016 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Designers have a saying that “the joy of an early release lasts but a short time. The bitterness of an unusable system lasts for years.” It is indeed disappointing to discover that your data resources are not being used to their full potential. Not only have you invested your time, effort, and research grant on the project, but you may face costly redesigns if you want to improve the system later. This scenario would be less likely if the product was designed to provide users with exactly what they need, so that it is fit for purpose before its launch. We work at EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), and we consult extensively with life science researchers to find out what they need from biological data resources. We have found that although users believe that the bioinformatics community is providing accurate and valuable data, they often find the interfaces to these resources tricky to use and navigate. We believe that if you can find out what your users want even before you create the first mock-up of a system, the final product will provide a better user experience. This would encourage more people to use the resource and they would have greater access to the data, which could ultimately lead to more scientific discoveries. In this paper, we explore the need for a user-centred design (UCD) strategy when designing bioinformatics resources and illustrate this with examples from our work at EMBL-EBI. Our aim is to introduce the reader to how selected UCD techniques may be successfully applied to software design for bioinformatics.},

  abstract = {Targeted genomic regulation is a powerful approach to accelerate trait discovery and development in agricultural biotechnology. Bacteria and archaea use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) regulatory systems for adaptive molecular immunity against foreign nucleic acids introduced by invading phages and conjugative plasmids. The type II CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing in many cell types and organisms. A recent study used the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein combined with guide-RNAs (gRNAs) as a DNA-targeting platform to modulate gene expression in bacterial, yeast, and human cells. Here, we modified this DNA-targeting platform for targeted transcriptional regulation in planta by developing chimeric dCas9-based transcriptional activators and repressors. To generate transcriptional activators, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the activation domains of EDLL and TAL effectors. To generate a transcriptional repressor, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the SRDX repression domain. Our data demonstrate that dCas9 fusion with the EDLL activation domain (dCas9:EDLL) and the TAL activation domain (dCas9:TAD), guided by gRNAs complementary to selected promoter elements, induce strong transcriptional activation on Bs3::uidA targets in plant cells. Further, the dCas9:SRDX-mediated transcriptional repression of an endogenous gene. Thus, our results suggest that the synthetic transcriptional repressor (dCas9:SRDX) and activators (dCas9:EDLL and dCas9:TAD) can be used as endogenous transcription factors to repress or activate transcription of an endogenous genomic target. Our data indicate that the CRISPR/dCas9 DNA-targeting platform can be used in plants as a functional genomics tool and for biotechnological applications.},

It has been proposed that housekeeping genes are evolutionarily slower than tissue specific genes. In the present communication, we have examined different determinants that influence the evolutionary rate variation in human housekeeping and tissue specific proteins present in protein–protein interaction network. Studies on yeast proteome, revealed a predominant role of protein connectivity in determining the rate of protein evolution. However, in human, we did not observe any significant influence of protein connectivity on its evolutionary rate. Rather, a significant impact of the proportion of protein's interacting length (amount of protein interface involved in interaction with its partners), expression level and multifunctionality has been observed in determining the rate of protein evolution. We also observed that multi interface proteins are evolutionarily conserved between housekeeping and tissue specific genes and it has been found that the average number of biological processes they associated in these two sets of genes is similar. Moreover, single interface proteins in housekeeping genes evolve more slowly as compared to tissue specific genes owing to their involvement in different number of biological processes. Partial correlation analysis suggests that the relative importance of three individual factors in determining the evolutionary rate variation between housekeeping and tissue specific proteins is in the order of protein multifunctionality{$>$}protein expression level{$>$}interacting protein length.},

  abstract = {High-efficiency methods for DNA assembly have enabled the routine assembly of synthetic DNAs of increased size and complexity. However, these techniques require customization, elaborate vector sets or serial manipulations for the different stages of assembly. We have developed Loop assembly based on a recursive approach to DNA fabrication. The system makes use of two Type IIS restriction endonucleases and corresponding vector sets for efficient and parallel assembly of large DNA circuits. Standardized level 0 parts can be assembled into circuits containing 1, 4, 16 or more genes by looping between the two vector sets. The vectors also contain modular sites for hybrid assembly using sequence overlap methods. Loop assembly enables efficient and versatile DNA fabrication for plant transformation. We show the construction of plasmids up to 16 genes and 38 kb with high efficiency ({$>$} 80\%). We have characterized Loop assembly on over 200 different DNA constructs and validated the fidelity of the method by high-throughput Illumina plasmid sequencing. Our method provides a simple generalized solution for DNA construction with standardized parts. The cloning system is provided under an OpenMTA license for unrestricted sharing and open access.},

Over 300 promoter sequences from a small, well-conserved family of plant transcription factors known as Cytokinin Response Factors (CRFs) were examined for conserved motifs across several known clades present in Angiosperms. General CRF and lineage specific motifs were identified. Once identified, significantly enriched motifs were then compared to known transcription factor binding sites to elucidate potential functional roles. Additionally, presence of similar motifs shows that levels of conservation exist between different CRFs across land plants, likely occurring through processes of neo- or sub-functionalization. Furthermore, significant patterns of motif conservation are seen within and between CRF clades suggesting cis-regulatory regions have been conserved throughout CRF evolution.},

Extensive transcriptional networks play major roles in cellular and organismal functions. Transcript levels are in part determined by the combinatorial and overlapping functions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound to gene promoters. Thus, TF-promoter interactions provide the basic molecular wiring of transcriptional regulatory networks. In plants, discovery of the functional roles of TFs is limited by an increased complexity of network circuitry due to a significant expansion of TF families. Here, we present the construction of a comprehensive collection of Arabidopsis TFs clones created to provide a versatile resource for uncovering TF biological functions. We leveraged this collection by implementing a high-throughput DNA binding assay and identified direct regulators of a key clock gene (CCA1) that provide molecular links between different signaling modules and the circadian clock. The resources introduced in this work will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the transcriptional regulatory landscape of plant genomes.},

Consistent with this hypothesis, gene expression data from both yeasts and mammals show a substantial decrease in the level of gene expression after duplication. Whereas the majority of the expression reductions are likely to be neutral, some are apparently beneficial to rebalancing gene dosage after duplication.},

  abstract = {DNA-binding proteins play pivotal roles in alternative splicing, RNA editing, methylating and many other biological functions for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes. Predicting the functions of these proteins from primary amino acids sequences is becoming one of the major challenges in functional annotations of genomes. Traditional prediction methods often devote themselves to extracting physiochemical features from sequences but ignoring motif information and location information between motifs. Meanwhile, the small scale of data volumes and large noises in training data result in lower accuracy and reliability of predictions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method to identify DNA-binding proteins from primary sequences alone. It utilizes two stages of convolutional neutral network to detect the function domains of protein sequences, and the long short-term memory neural network to identify their long term dependencies, an binary cross entropy to evaluate the quality of the neural networks. When the proposed method is tested with a realistic DNA binding protein dataset, it achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.2\% at the Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.961. Compared with the LibSVM on the arabidopsis and yeast datasets via independent tests, the accuracy raises by 9\% and 4\% respectively. Comparative experiments using different feature extraction methods show that our model performs similar accuracy with the best of others, but its values of sensitivity, specificity and AUC increase by 27.83\%, 1.31\% and 16.21\% respectively. Those results suggest that our method is a promising tool for identifying DNA-binding proteins.},

  abstract = {Molecular tools adapted from bacterial CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems for adaptive immunity have become widely used for plant genome engineering, both to investigate gene functions and to engineer desirable traits. A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called 'off-targets' by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content of the target correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that 'high-fidelity' variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants. We present these molecular tools as standardised DNA parts to facilitate their re-use.},

Using available expression and transcription factor binding data, literature on transcriptional regulation, and known rules of promoter architecture we improved the low-pH performance of the YGP1 promoter by modifying transcription factor binding sites in its upstream activation sequence. The engineering strategy outlined for the YGP1 promoter was subsequently applied to create a response to low pH in the unrelated CCW14 promoter. We applied our best promoter variants to low-pH fermentations, enabling ten-fold increased production of lactic acid compared to titres obtained with the commonly used, native TEF1 promoter.

Here we address this shortcoming by establishing a methodical workflow necessary to identify robust minimal core elements that can be linked with minimal upstream activating sequences to develop short, yet strong yeast promoters. Through a series of library-based synthesis, analysis and robustness tests, we create a set of non-homologous, purely synthetic, minimal promoters for yeast. These promoters are comprised of short core elements that are generic and interoperable and 10 bp UAS elements that impart strong, constitutive function. Through this methodology, we are able to generate the shortest fungal promoters to date, which can achieve high levels of both inducible and constitutive expression with up to an 80\% reduction in size.},

  abstract = {We describe the development of a high-density Arabidopsis'whole genome' oligonucleotide probe array for expression analysis (the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip probe array) that contains approximately 22 750 probe sets. Precedence on the array was given to genes for which either expression evidence or a credible database match existed. The remaining space was filled with 'hypothetical' genes. The new ATH1 array represents approximately 23 750 genes of which 60\% were detected in RNA from cultured seedlings. Sensitivity of the array, determined using spiking controls, was approximately one transcript per cell. The array demonstrated high technical reproducibility and concordance with real-time PCR results. Indole-3 acetic acid (IAA)-induced changes in gene expression were used for biological validation of the array. A total of 222 genes were significantly upregulated and 103 significantly downregulated by exposure to IAA. Of the genes whose products could be functionally classified, the largest specific classes of upregulated genes were transcriptional regulators and protein kinases, many fewer of which were represented among the downregulated genes. Over one-third of the auxin-regulated genes have no known function, although many belong to gene families with members that have previously been shown to be auxin regulated. For the 6714 genes represented both on this and the earlier Arabidopsis Genome (AG) array, both signal intensities and gene expression ratios were very similar. Mapping of the oligonucleotides on the ATH1 array to the latest (version 4.0) annotation showed that over 95\% of the probe sets (based on version 2.0 annotation) still fully represented their original target genes.},

Unfortunately, the running time of EM is linear in the length of the input sequences. This can prohibit its application to data sets of the size commonly generated by high-throughput biological techniques. A suffix tree is a data structure that can efficiently index a set of sequences. We describe an algorithm, Suffix Tree EM for Motif Elicitation (STEME), that approximates EM using suffix trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of suffix trees to EM. We provide an analysis of the expected running time of the algorithm and demonstrate that STEME runs an order of magnitude more quickly than the implementation of EM used by MEME. We give theoretical bounds for the quality of the approximation and show that, in practice, the approximation has a negligible effect on the outcome. We provide an open source implementation of the algorithm that we hope will be used to speed up existing and future motif search algorithms.},

The DNA base-pair-step geometry has, overall, twice the curvature necessary to accommodate the DNA superhelical path in the nucleosome. DNA segments bent into the minor groove are either kinked or alternately shifted. The unusual DNA conformational parameters induced by the binding of histone protein have implications for sequence-dependent protein recognition and nucleosome positioning and mobility.

  abstract = {Integration of environmental and endogenous cues at plant shoot meristems determines the timing of flowering and reproductive development. The MADS box transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) of Arabidopsis thaliana is an important repressor of floral transition, which blocks flowering until plants are exposed to winter cold. However, the target genes of FLC have not been thoroughly described, and our understanding of the mechanisms by which FLC represses transcription of these targets and how this repression is overcome during floral transition is still fragmentary. Here, we identify and characterize TARGET OF FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1), a novel target gene of FLC and its interacting protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). TFS1 encodes a B3-type transcription factor, and we show that tfs1 mutants are later flowering than wild-type, particularly under short days. FLC and SVP repress TFS1 transcription leading to deposition of trimethylation of Iysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 at the TFS1 locus. During floral transition, after downregulation of FLC by cold, TFS1 transcription is promoted by SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS box protein encoded by another target of FLC/SVP. SOC1 opposes PRC function at TFS1 through recruitment of the histone demethylase RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6) and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler ATPase BRAHMA (BRM). This recruitment of BRM is also strictly required for SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9 (SPL9) binding at TFS1 to coordinate RNAPII recruitment through the Mediator complex. Thus, we show that antagonistic chromatin modifications mediated by different MADS box transcription factor complexes play a crucial role in defining the temporal and spatial patterns of transcription of genes within a network of interactions downstream of FLC/SVP during floral transition.},

In subjects without any vulnerability for mood disorders, performance on so-called ‘frontal tasks,’ measuring higher attentional functions tended to improve after ATD. The effects of ATD on mood and cognition were manifest as long as biochemical indices of low tryptophan remained low. In conclusion, ATD is a model for impairment of memory, next to being a model of mood disorders in vulnerable subjects. Moreover, ATD could be used as a challenge to demonstrate individual vulnerability of the serotonergic system.},

Acquired resistance phenomena also impair antifungals, antivirals, anti-cancer drug therapy, while herbicide resistance in weeds threatens the crop industry. On the positive side, it is likely that the chemical space of natural products goes far beyond what has currently been discovered. This idea is fueled by genome sequencing of microorganisms which unveiled numerous so-called cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), many of which are transcriptionally silent under laboratory culture conditions, and by the fact that most bacteria cannot yet be cultivated in the laboratory. However, brute force antibiotic discovery does not yield the same results as it did in the past, and researchers have had to develop creative strategies in order to unravel the hidden potential of microorganisms such as Streptomyces and other antibiotic-producing microorganisms. Identifying the cis elements and their corresponding transcription factors(s) involved in the control of BGCs through bioinformatic approaches is a promising strategy. Theoretically, we are a few 'clicks' away from unveiling the culturing conditions or genetic changes needed to activate the production of cryptic metabolites or increase the production yield of known compounds to make them economically viable. In this opinion article, we describe and illustrate the idea beyond 'cracking' the regulatory code for natural product discovery, by presenting a series of proofs of concept, and discuss what still should be achieved to increase the rate of success of this strategy.

However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse \emph{cis-}regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits \emph{trans}-generational heritability of \emph{Cas9} activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse agricultural traits, our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Pathogen-inducible plant promoters contain multiple cis-acting elements, only some of which may contribute to pathogen inducibility. Therefore, we made defined synthetic promoters containing tetramers of only a single type of element and present evidence that a range of cis-acting elements (boxes W1, W2, GCC, JERE, S, Gst1, and D) can mediate local gene expression in planta after pathogen attack. The expression patterns of the promoters were monitored during interactions with a number of pathogens, including compatible, incompatible, and nonhost interactions. Interestingly, there were major differences in the inducibilities of the various promoters with the pathogens tested as well as differences in the speed of induction and in the basal expression levels. We also show that defense signaling is largely conserved across species boundaries at the cis-acting element level. Many of these promoters also direct local wound-induced expression, and this provides evidence for the convergence of resistance gene, nonhost, and wound responses at the level of the promoter elements. We have used these cis-acting elements to construct improved synthetic promoters and show the effects of varying the number, order, and spacing of such elements. These promoters are valuable additions to the study of signaling and transcriptional activation during plant–pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {The molecular components of transcriptional regulation are modular. Transcription factors have domains for specific functions such as DNA binding, dimerization, and protein–protein interactions associated with transcriptional activation and repression. Similarly, promoters are modular. They consist of combinations of cis-acting elements that are the binding sites for transcription factors. It is this promoter architecture that largely determines the expression pattern of a gene. The modular nature of promoters is supported by the observation that many cis-acting elements retain their activities when they are taken out of their native promoter context and used as building blocks in synthetic promoters. We therefore have a large collection of cis-acting elements to use in building synthetic promoters and many minimal promoters upon which to build them. This review discusses what we have learned concerning how to use these building blocks to make synthetic promoters. It has become clear that we can increase the strength of a promoter by adding increasing numbers of cis-acting elements. However, it appears that there may be a sweet spot with regard to inducibility as promoters with increasing numbers of copies of an element often show increased background expression. Spacing between elements appears important because if elements are placed too close together activity is lost, presumably due to reduced transcription factor binding due to steric hindrance. In many cases, promoters that contain combinations of cis-acting elements show better expression characteristics than promoters that contain a single type of element. This may be because multiple transcription factor binding sites in the promoter places it at the end of multiple signal transduction pathways. Finally, some cis-acting elements form functional units with other elements and are inactive on their own. In such cases, the complete unit is required for function in a synthetic promoter. Taken together, we have learned much about how to construct synthetic promoters and this knowledge will be crucial in both designing promoters to drive transgenes and also as components of defined regulatory networks in synthetic biology.},

Here we describe a high-resolution, genome-scale approach for quantifying chromatin accessibility by measuring DNase I sensitivity as a continuous function of genome position using tiling DNA microarrays (DNase-array). We demonstrate this approach across 1\% (∼30 Mb) of the human genome, wherein we localized 2,690 classical DNase I hypersensitive sites with high sensitivity and specificity, and also mapped larger-scale patterns of chromatin architecture. DNase I hypersensitive sites exhibit marked aggregation around transcriptional start sites (TSSs), though the majority mark nonpromoter functional elements. We also developed a computational approach for visualizing higher-order features of chromatin structure. This revealed that human chromatin organization is dominated by large (100–500 kb) 'superclusters' of DNase I hypersensitive sites, which encompass both gene-rich and gene-poor regions. DNase-array is a powerful and straightforward approach for systematic exposition of the cis-regulatory architecture of complex genomes.},

Focal alteration in chromatin structure in vivo, detectable through hypersensitivity to DNaseI and other nucleases, is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. We developed an approach for genome-scale identification of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) via isolation and cloning of in vivo DNaseI cleavage sites to create libraries of active chromatin sequences (ACSs). Here, we describe analysis of {$>$}61,000 ACSs derived from erythroid cells. We observed peaks in the density of ACSs at the transcriptional start sites of known genes at non-gene-associated CpG islands, and, to a lesser degree, at evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences. Peaks in ACS density paralleled the distribution of DNaseI HSs. ACSs and DNaseI HSs were distributed between both expressed and nonexpressed genes, suggesting that a large proportion of genes reside within open chromatin domains. The results permit a quantitative approximation of the distribution of HSs and classical cis-regulatory sequences in the human genome.},

The results showed that the greatest enhancement of the skin transport occurs at the highest concentration of the enhancer (P {$<$} 0.01).

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. The present study assessed autonomic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and skin temperature to determine the arousal level of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, subjects were asked to estimate their mood responses such as feeling pleasant or unpleasant, uncomfortable, sensuality, relaxation, or refreshing in order to assess subjective behavioral arousal. Finally, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 31 electrodes on the scalp according to the international 10 to 20 system, and EEG power spectra were calculated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Data was analyzed by comparing the effects of lavender oil on physiological and mood states with sweet almond oil. These assessments were measured before and after using paired t-test statistical procedure.
RESULTS: The results revealed that lavender oil caused significant decreases of blood pressure, heart rate, and skin temperature, which indicated a decrease of autonomic arousal. In terms of mood responses, the subjects in the lavender oil group categorized themselves as more active, fresher relaxed than subjects just inhaling base oil. Compared with base oil, lavender oil increased the power of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) brain activities. The topographic map showed obviously more scattering power in alpha range waves particularly in bilateral temporal and central area.
CONCLUSION: The findings provided evidence the relaxing effect of inhaling lavender oil.},

We observed that the expression levels of transcription factor genes and signal transduction components are similar to those of metabolic genes. Examining the expression patterns of large gene families, we found that they are often more similar than would be expected by chance, indicating that many gene families have been co-opted for specific developmental processes.},

  abstract = {Transcriptions factors (TFs) are pivotal for the regulation of virtually all cellular processes, including growth and development. Expansions of TF families are causally linked to increases in organismal complexity. Here we study the evolutionary dynamics, genetic causes and functional implications of the five largest metazoan TF families. We find that family expansions dominate across the whole metazoan tree; however, some branches experience exceptional family-specific accelerated expansions. Additionally, we find that such expansions are often predated by modular domain rearrangements, which spur the expansion of a new sub-family by separating it from the rest of the TF family in terms of protein–protein interactions. This separation allows for radical shifts in the functional spectrum of a duplicated TF. We also find functional differentiation inside TF sub-families as changes in expression specificity. Furthermore, accelerated family expansions are facilitated by repeats of sequence motifs such as C2H2 zinc fingers. We quantify whole genome duplications and single gene duplications as sources of TF family expansions, implying that some, but not all, TF duplicates are preferentially retained. We conclude that trans-regulatory changes (domain rearrangements) are instrumental for fundamental functional innovations, that cis-regulatory changes (affecting expression) accomplish wide-spread fine tuning and both jointly contribute to the functional diversification of TFs.},

  abstract = {Chromatin is of major relevance for gene expression, cell division, and differentiation. Here, we determined the landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana chromatin states using 16 features, including DNA sequence, CG methylation, histone variants, and modifications. The combinatorial complexity of chromatin can be reduced to nine states that describe chromatin with high resolution and robustness. Each chromatin state has a strong propensity to associate with a subset of other states defining a discrete number of chromatin motifs. These topographical relationships revealed that an intergenic state, characterized by H3K27me3 and slightly enriched in activation marks, physically separates the canonical Polycomb chromatin and two heterochromatin states from the rest of the euchromatin domains. Genomic elements are distinguished by specific chromatin states: four states span genes from transcriptional start sites (TSS) to termination sites and two contain regulatory regions upstream of TSS. Polycomb regions and the rest of the euchromatin can be connected by two major chromatin paths. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the occurrence of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in the same chromatin fiber, within a two to three nucleosome size range. Our data provide insight into the Arabidopsis genome topography and the establishment of gene expression patterns, specification of DNA replication origins, and definition of chromatin domains.},

We devised a method for obtaining parallel, highly accurate gene expression measurements from thousands of designed promoters and applied it to measure the effect of systematic changes in the location, number, orientation, affinity and organization of transcription-factor binding sites and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Our analyses reveal a clear relationship between expression and binding-site multiplicity, as well as dependencies of expression on the distance between transcription-factor binding sites and gene starts which are transcription-factor specific, including a striking ∼10-bp periodic relationship between gene expression and binding-site location. We show how this approach can measure transcription-factor sequence specificities and the sensitivity of transcription-factor sites to the surrounding sequence context, and compare the activity of 75 yeast transcription factors. Our method can be used to study both cis and trans effects of genotype on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational control.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs), which are central to the regulation of gene expression, are usually members of multigene families. In plants, they are involved in diverse processes such as developmental control and elicitation of defense and stress responses. To investigate if differences exist in the expansion patterns of TF gene families between plants and other eukaryotes, we first used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TFs to identify TF DNA-binding domains. These DNA-binding domains were then used to identify related sequences in 25 other eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, among 19 families that are shared between animals and plants, more than 14 are larger in plants than in animals. After examining the lineage-specific expansion of TF families in two plants, eight animals, and two fungi, we found that TF families shared among these organisms have undergone much more dramatic expansion in plants than in other eukaryotes. Moreover, this elevated expansion rate of plant TF is not simply due to higher duplication rates of plant genomes but also to a higher degree of expansion compared to other plant genes. Further, in many Arabidopsis-rice (Oryza sativa) TF orthologous groups, the degree of lineage-specific expansion in Arabidopsis is correlated with that in rice. This pattern of parallel expansion is much more pronounced than the whole-genome trend in rice and Arabidopsis. The high rate of expansion among plant TF genes and their propensity for parallel expansion suggest frequent adaptive responses to selection pressure common among higher plants.},

Recent studies in flies reported that H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin is accessible while H3K27me3-marked chromatin forms extensive domains of low accessibility. Here we show that plants regulate DNA accessibility differently. H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin is the least accessible in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and H3K27me3-marked chromatin also has low accessibility. We see that very long genes without H3K9me2 or H3K27me3 are often inaccessible and generated significantly lower amounts of antisense transcripts than other genes, suggesting that reduced accessibility is associated with reduced recognition of alternative promoters. Low accessibility of H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin and long genes depend on cytosine methylation, explaining why chromatin accessibility differs between plants and flies. Together, we conclude that restriction of DNA accessibility is a local property of chromatin and not necessarily a consequence of microscopically visible compaction.},

Methods that measure DNA accessibility at local and genome-wide scales have facilitated a rapid increase in the knowledge of chromatin architecture in animal and yeast systems. In contrast, much less is known about chromatin organization in plants. We developed a robust DNase I-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). DNA accessibility is probed by digesting nuclei with a gradient of DNase I followed by locus-specific PCR. The reduction in PCR product formation along the gradient of increasing DNase I concentrations is used to determine the accessibility of the chromatin DNA. We explain a strategy to calculate the decay constant of such signal reduction as a function of increasing DNase I concentration. This allows describing DNA accessibility using a single variable: the decay constant. We also used the protocol together with AGRONOMICS1 DNA tiling microarrays to establish genome-wide DNase I sensitivity landscapes.},

  abstract = {Cell differentiation is driven by changes in the activity of transcription factors (TFs) and subsequent alterations in transcription. To study this process, differences in TF binding between cell types can be deduced by probing chromatin accessibility. We used cell type-specific nuclear purification followed by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) to delineate differences in chromatin accessibility and TF regulatory networks between stem cells of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and differentiated leaf mesophyll cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromatin accessibility profiles of SAM stem cells and leaf mesophyll cells were very similar at a qualitative level, yet thousands of regions having quantitatively different chromatin accessibility were also identified. Analysis of the genomic regions preferentially accessible in each cell type identified hundreds of overrepresented TF-binding motifs, highlighting sets of TFs that are probably important for each cell type. Within these sets, we found evidence for extensive co-regulation of target genes by multiple TFs that are preferentially expressed in each cell type. Interestingly, the TFs within each of these cell type-enriched sets also showed evidence of extensively co-regulating each other. We further found that preferentially accessible chromatin regions in mesophyll cells tended to also be substantially accessible in the stem cells, whereas the converse was not true. This observation suggests that the generally higher accessibility of regulatory elements in stem cells might contribute to their developmental plasticity. This work demonstrates the utility of cell type-specific chromatin accessibility profiling for the rapid development of testable models of regulatory control differences between cell types.},

At the same time, this situation has hindered regular adoption of these tools in clinical practice.

To address these issues, it is necessary to re-think how biomedical applications are built and adopt new strategies that ensure quality, efficiency, robustness, correctness and reusability of software components. We also need to engage end-users during the development process to ensure that applications fit their needs.

The present review will focus on the complex post-transcriptional regulation of ERbeta (oestrogen receptor beta) expression. In particular, results from our laboratory suggest that the expression of alternative 5'-UTRs plays a key role in determining the level of ERbeta protein expression. We have also shown that these alternative ERbeta 5'-UTRs have a tissue-specific distribution and are differentially expressed between various normal and tumour tissues. Our results also suggest that alternative 5'-UTRs can influence downstream splicing events, thereby perhaps affecting ERbeta function. These results suggest that alternative 5'-UTRs may have an overall influence on ER activity and this may have important implications for our understanding of cancer biology and treatment.},

We have used formaldehyde-mediated proteinDNA crosslinking within intact cells to examine the in vivo chromatin structure of the D. melanogaster heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the heat shockmediated transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes perturbs their chromatin structure, resulting in fewer proteinDNA contacts crosslinkable in vivo by formaldehyde. However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivocrosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe proteinDNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.},

To identify regulatory elements active in seven cell lines representative of diverse human cell types, we used DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) to map “open chromatin.” Over 870,000 DNaseI or FAIRE sites, which correspond tightly to nucleosome-depleted regions, were identified across the seven cell lines, covering nearly 9\% of the genome. The combination of DNaseI and FAIRE is more effective than either assay alone in identifying likely regulatory elements, as judged by coincidence with transcription factor binding locations determined in the same cells. Open chromatin common to all seven cell types tended to be at or near transcription start sites and to be coincident with CTCF binding sites, while open chromatin sites found in only one cell type were typically located away from transcription start sites and contained DNA motifs recognized by regulators of cell-type identity. We show that open chromatin regions bound by CTCF are potent insulators. We identified clusters of open regulatory elements (COREs) that were physically near each other and whose appearance was coordinated among one or more cell types. Gene expression and RNA Pol II binding data support the hypothesis that COREs control gene activity required for the maintenance of cell-type identity. This publicly available atlas of regulatory elements may prove valuable in identifying noncoding DNA sequence variants that are causally linked to human disease.},

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR is a powerful technique that enables elucidation of regulatory relationships through quantifying transcript levels, but its reliability requires precise normalization. We compared eight Arabidopsis thaliana housekeeping genes for expression stability after treatment with cytokinins, auxins, ethylene and after macronutrient level manipulation. The expression stability of housekeeping genes in cytokinin series was studied in wide spectrum of plants treated with different adenine- and phenylurea-type cytokinins as well as in plants with controlled overexpression of agrobacterial isopentenyltransferase. NormFinder and geNorm software were used to predict a unique set of genes as best for particular hormone groups. Generally, 18S rRNA, GAPC, and ACT were confirmed as less stable; and UBQ10, UBC, and EF-1α exhibited increased stability. Based on geNorm pairwise variation analysis, we confirmed accurate normalization required at least three reference genes.},

By tethering Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) to a chromatin protein, Dam can be targeted in vivo to native binding sites of this protein, resulting in local DNA methylation. Sites of methylation can subsequently be mapped using methylation-specific restriction enzymes or antibodies. We demonstrate the successful application of DamID both in Drosophila cell cultures and in whole flies. When Dam is tethered to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, targeted methylation is limited to a region of a few kilobases surrounding a GAL4 binding sequence. Using DamID, we identified a number of expected and unexpected target loci for Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1. DamID has potential for genome-wide mapping of in vivo targets of chromatin proteins in various eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~Food is not only necessary as a metabolic fuel for the body, it becomes more and more evident that there exists an association between food and brain functions like mood and cognition. Tryptophan represents a key element for brain functioning, because of its role as a precursor for production of neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). In clinical conditions, which involve chronic immune system activation or under cytokine therapy, lower tryptophan levels because of high catabolism of tryptophan as indicated by the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio are common and often associate with depressive mood.
        Recent findings~Studies in the in vitro model of mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that several phytocompounds, mainly antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamins, can interfere with inflammatory signaling cascades including tryptophan breakdown. If extrapolated to the in vivo situation, such compounds could increase blood and brain tryptophan availability for serotonin production. Although there is some in vivo evidence for the effect of such compounds, outcomes are hardly predictable and most likely depend on the individual's immunological state.
        Summary~Not only a diet rich in tryptophan but also a diet rich in antioxidants can have a positive impact on mood and cognition. This could be of special relevance for individuals who present with low grade inflammation conditions.},

The accessibility and critical function of epidermal cells have made them a model for connecting transcriptional events to development in a range of model systems. In Arabidopsis and many other plants, fertilization triggers differentiation of specialized epidermal cells called the seed coat that have a unique morphology caused by large extracellular deposits of pectin. Here, we used DNase I-seq to generate regulatory landscapes of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds at two points in development. To enrich for seed coat signals, we used the INTACT method for capturing nuclei from GL2-expressing cells from whole siliques. Over half of the regulatory (i.e., accessible) bases identified in seeds at these two developmental time points had not been previously identified in seven-day-old seedling. We identified over 3000 regions that were developmentally dynamic (i.e., differentially accessible) at the two timepoints and found that genes neighboring these regions were enriched for gene ontology terms such as development, regulation and pigment. Genes neighboring differentially accessible regions were also significantly more likely to have differing expression at these two timepoints. The differentially accessible regions themselves were enriched for motifs belonging to transcription factors involved in development and environmental response, notably the TCP and MYB families at the earlier and later time points, respectively. These findings are consistent with previous studies, highlighting the dramatic changes that take place in the chromatin landscape during development, and indicating the importance of extending the approach described here to other cell types and developmental processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Surprisingly, over a quarter of the regulatory, i.e. accessible, bases observed in seeds were novel. Notably, plant regulatory landscapes from different tissues, cell types or developmental stages were more dynamic than those generated from bulk tissue in response to environmental perturbations, highlighting the importance of extending studies of regulatory DNA to single tissues and cell types during development.},

Multiple methods exist to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Both simulation and empirical studies have identified several “zones” of parameter space where accuracy of some methods can plummet, even for four-taxon trees. Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency and/or the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. Here we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods. While numerous practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that deep learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more accurate phylogenetic inferences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Sequence variation in CREs can impact gene expression levels, but also developmental timing and tissue specificity of expression. When genes are involved in multiple pathways or active in several organs and developmental stages CRE modifications are favored in contrast to mutations in coding regions, due to the lack of detrimental pleiotropic effects.

Here, we demonstrate that RNA labeling with a modified, non-toxic uridine analog, 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU), in \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} seedlings provides insight into the dynamic nature of a plant transcriptome. Pulse-labeling with 5-EU allowed the detection and analysis of nascent and unstable RNAs, of RNA processing intermediates generated by splicing, and of chloroplast RNAs. We also conducted pulse-chase experiments with 5-EU, which allowed us to determine RNA stabilities without the need for chemical inhibition of transcription using compounds such as actinomycin and cordycepin. Genome-wide analysis of RNA stabilities by 5-EU pulse-chase experiments revealed that this inhibitor-free RNA stability measurement results in RNA half-lives much shorter than those reported after chemical inhibition of transcription. In summary, our results show that the Arabidopsis nascent transcriptome contains unstable RNAs and RNA processing intermediates, and suggest that half-lives of plant RNAs are largely overestimated. Our results lay the ground for an easy and affordable nascent transcriptome analysis and inhibitor-free analysis of RNA stabilities in plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Saliva samples were collected from 15 healthy females before and immediately after the one-hour examination, and two hours after the examination. Salivary cortisol, IgA, and CgA concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both IgA and CgA concentrations statistically increased immediately after the examination (P {$<$} 0.05) and decreased two hours after the examination. No significant differences were observed between before and after the examination in the salivary cortisol concentration. These findings suggest that the acute stress due to the examination is associated with raised salivary IgA and CgA, but not cortisol.},

  abstract = {Plant GAGA-motif binding factors are encoded by the BARLEY B RECOMBINANT / BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BBR/BPC) family, which fulfill indispensable functions in growth and development. BBR/BPC proteins control flower development, size of the stem cell niche and seed development through transcriptional regulation of homeotic transcription factor genes. They are responsible for the context dependent recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) or other repressive proteins to GAGA-motifs, which are contained in Polycomb repressive DNA-elements (PREs). Hallmark of the protein family is the highly conserved BPC domain, which is required for DNA binding. Here we study the evolution and diversification of the BBR/BPC family and its DNA-binding domain. Our analyses supports a further division of the family into four main groups (I-IV) and several subgroups, to resolve a strict monophyletic descent of the BPC domain. We prove a polyphyletic origin for group III proteins, which evolved from group I and II members through extensive loss of domains in the N-terminus. Conserved motif searches lend to the identification of a WAKHGTN consensus and a TIR/K motif at the very C-terminus of the BPC-domain. We could show by DPI-ELISA that this signature is required for DNA-binding in AtBPC1. Additional binding studies with mutated oligonucleotides consolidated the binding to GAGA tetramers. To validate these findings, we used previously published ChIP-seq data from GFP-BPC6. We uncovered that many genes of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway are targeted by AtBPC6. Consistently, bpc6, bpc4 bpc6 and lhp1 bpc4 bpc4 mutants display brassinosteroid-dependent root growth phenotypes. Both, a function in brassinosteroid signaling and our phylogenetic data supports a link between BBR/BPC diversification in the land plant lineage and the complexity of flower and seed plant evolution.},

In P. patens, BAN expression is activated by a complex composed of three proteins (TT2/AtMYB123, TT8/bHLH042 and TTG1), and is inhibited by MYBL2, a transcriptional repressor, as in Arabidopsis. Using this approach, two new regulatory sequences that are necessary and sufficient for specific BAN expression in proanthocyanidin-accumulating cells were identified. • This one hybrid-like plant system was successfully employed to quantitatively assess the transcriptional activity of four regulatory proteins, and to identify their target recognition sites on the BAN promoter.},

  abstract = {In animals, transcription by RNA polymerase II initiates bidirectionally from gene promoters to produce pre-mRNAs on the forward strand and promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) on the reverse strand. PROMPTs are degraded by the nuclear exosome. Previous studies based on nascent RNA approaches concluded that Arabidopsis thaliana does not produce PROMPTs. Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including the exosome, to reassess the existence of A. thaliana PROMPTs. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, \textasciitilde 100 cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs were identified. Such PROMPTs are sources of small interfering RNAs in exosome-deficient mutants, perhaps explaining why plants have evolved mechanisms to suppress PROMPTs. In addition, we found \textasciitilde 200 transcription start sites within 3'-UTR-encoding regions that produce long unspliced, exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs. The previously characterized non-coding (nc) RNA that regulates expression of the key seed dormancy regulator, DELAY OF GERMINATION1, is a typical representative of this class of RNAs. Transcription factor genes are overrepresented among loci with exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs, suggesting a potential for widespread control of gene expression via this class of ncRNAs. Lastly, we assess the use of alternative promoters in A. thaliana and compare the accuracy of existing TSS annotations.},

The current study utilised a placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced, crossover design in order to comprehensively assess any mood and cognition modulation by S. lavandulaefolia. Twenty-four participants received single doses of placebo, 25 μl and 50 μl of a standardised essential oil of S. lavandulaefolia in an order dictated by a Latin square. Doses were separated by a 7-day washout period. Cognitive performance was assessed prior to the day's treatment and at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 h thereafter using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerised test battery. Subjective mood ratings were measured using Bond–Lader visual analogue scales. The primary outcome measures were scores on the five cognitive factors that can be derived by factor analysis of the task outcomes from the CDR battery. The results showed that administration of S. lavandulaefolia resulted in a consistent improvement for both the 25- and 50-μl dose on the ‘Speed of Memory’ factor. There was also an improvement on the ‘Secondary Memory’ factor for the 25-μl dose. Mood was consistently enhanced, with increases in self-rated ‘alertness’, ‘calmness’ and ‘contentedness’ following the 50-μl dose and elevated ‘calmness’ following 25 μl. These results represent further evidence that Salvia is capable of acute modulation of mood and cognition in healthy young adults. The data also suggest that previous reports of memory enhancement by Salvia may be due to more efficient retrieval of target material.},

  abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y−1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y−1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

We evaluated the stress relief effect of lavender aroma by measuring sensitive salivary endocrinological stress markers, cortisol and chromogranin A (CgA).
Design
Thirty healthy students performed a serial arithmetic task for 10min and then rested for 10min. During the resting period, 16 students (aroma group) were exposed to airborne organic essential oil of lavender. Saliva samples were collected immediately before and after the arithmetic task, and at 5 and 10min after that. Salivary cortisol and CgA levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
In the aroma group, levels of CgA that had been elevated at the end of the arithmetic task were statistically significantly lower 10min later. The control group showed no such change. During the protocol, no statistically significant changes in levels of cortisol were detected in either the aroma group or the control group.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that lavender aroma has a stress relief effect.},

This is particularly important during seedling establishment when the phytochrome photoreceptors activate photosynthetic pigment production for photoautotrophic growth. Phytochromes accomplish this partly through the suppression of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), negative regulators of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis. While the bZIP transcription factor LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a potent PIF antagonist, promotes photosynthetic pigment accumulation in response to light. Here we demonstrate that by directly targeting a common promoter cis-element (G-box), HY5 and PIFs form a dynamic activation-suppression transcriptional module responsive to light and temperature cues. This antagonistic regulatory module provides a simple, direct mechanism through which environmental change can redirect transcriptional control of genes required for photosynthesis and photoprotection. In the regulation of photopigment biosynthesis genes, HY5 and PIFs do not operate alone, but with the circadian clock. However, sudden changes in light or temperature conditions can trigger changes in HY5 and PIFs abundance that adjust the expression of common target genes to optimise photosynthetic performance and growth.},

We show that such long-range gene regulation in vivo involves spatial interactions between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping out. The spatial organization of a 200 kb region spanning the murine β-globin locus was analyzed in expressing erythroid and nonexpressing brain tissue. In brain, the globin cluster adopts a seemingly linear conformation. In erythroid cells the hypersensitive sites of the locus control region (LCR), located 40–60 kb away from the active genes, come in close spatial proximity with these genes. The intervening chromatin with inactive globin genes loops out. Moreover, two distant hypersensitive regions participate in these interactions. We propose that clustering of regulatory elements is key to creating and maintaining active chromatin domains and regulating transcription.},

Three crucial aspects to this developmental plasticity are the control of initiation, identity and activity of meristems. At the cellular level, the activity of meristems is controlled by balancing self-renewal in stem cells, amplifying divisions in their daughter cells, and cell differentiation. Recent studies in plants have uncovered transcription factors regulating meristem activity at cellular resolution, and regulatory networks that couple these factors with phytohormone signalling for global plant growth regulation. Here, we highlight selected recent advances in our understanding of the multidimensional transcriptional networks that regulate meristem activity and discuss emerging insights on how a selection of environmental cues impinges on these networks.},

Hoxa2 plays an important role in regulating the regional identity of rhombomere 2 (r2) and is the only Hox gene expressed in this segment. In this study, we found that a Hoxa2 cis-regulatory module consists of five elements that direct expression in r2 of the developing hindbrain. Surprisingly, the module is imbedded in the second coding exon of Hoxa2 and therefore may be constrained by both protein coding and gene regulatory requirements. This highly conserved enhancer consists of two consensus Sox binding sites and several additional elements that act in concert to direct strong r2 specific expression. Our findings provide important insight into the regulation of segmental identity in the anterior hindbrain. Furthermore, they have broader implications in designing arrays and interpreting data from global analyses of gene regulation because regulatory input from coding regions needs to be considered.},

We introduce several conceptual innovations to the analysis of time-series data in the area of predictive GRNs. Our resulting network now provides the “transcriptional logic” for transcription factor perturbations aimed at improving N-use efficiency, an important issue for global food production in marginal soils and for sustainable agriculture. More broadly, the combination of the time-based approaches we develop and deploy can be applied to uncover the temporal “transcriptional logic” for any response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.This study exploits time, the relatively unexplored fourth dimension of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), to learn the temporal transcriptional logic underlying dynamic nitrogen (N) signaling in plants. Our “just-in-time” analysis of time-series transcriptome data uncovered a temporal cascade of cis elements underlying dynamic N signaling. To infer transcription factor (TF)-target edges in a GRN, we applied a time-based machine learning method to 2,174 dynamic N-responsive genes. We experimentally determined a network precision cutoff, using TF-regulated genome-wide targets of three TF hubs (CRF4, SNZ, and CDF1), used to “prune” the network to 155 TFs and 608 targets. This network precision was reconfirmed using genome-wide TF-target regulation data for four additional TFs (TGA1, HHO5/6, and PHL1) not used in network pruning. These higher-confidence edges in the GRN were further filtered by independent TF-target binding data, used to calculate a TF “N-specificity” index. This refined GRN identifies the temporal relationship of known/validated regulators of N signaling (NLP7/8, TGA1/4, NAC4, HRS1, and LBD37/38/39) and 146 additional regulators. Six TFs—CRF4, SNZ, CDF1, HHO5/6, and PHL1—validated herein regulate a significant number of genes in the dynamic N response, targeting 54\% of N-uptake/assimilation pathway genes. Phenotypically, inducible overexpression of CRF4 in planta regulates genes resulting in altered biomass, root development, and 15NO3− uptake, specifically under low-N conditions. This dynamic N-signaling GRN now provides the temporal “transcriptional logic” for 155 candidate TFs to improve nitrogen use efficiency with potential agricultural applications. Broadly, these time-based approaches can uncover the temporal transcriptional logic for any biological response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.},

The availability of inexpensive high-density SNP-genotyping arrays is encouraging the plant genetics and breeding community to undertake genome-wide marker genotyping for a variety of applications. For instance, high-throughput and low cost genotyping assays for gene-based markers offers the possibility to accelerate the trait mapping based on high-density linkage mapping as well as genome-scanning based association mapping approaches in addition to facilitate physical mapping, comparative mapping, phylogenetic studies and understanding genome organization in crop plant species.

Furthermore, the recent adoption of a common syntax to facilitate the exchange of plant DNA parts (phytobricks) is a promising strategy to speed up genetic engineering. Following this lead, here, we present a platform for plant biodesign that incorporates functional descriptions of phytobricks obtained under pre-defined experimental conditions, and systematically registers the resulting information as metadata for documentation. To facilitate the handling of functional descriptions, we developed a new version (v3.0) of the GoldenBraid (GB) webtool that integrates the experimental data and displays it in the form of datasheets. We report the use of the Luciferase/Renilla (Luc/Ren) transient agroinfiltration assay in Nicotiana benthamiana as a standard to estimate relative transcriptional activities conferred by regulatory phytobricks, and show the consistency and reproducibility of this method in the characterization of a synthetic phytobrick based on the CaMV35S promoter. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential for combinatorial optimization and incremental innovation of the GB3.0 platform in two separate examples, (i) the development of a collection of orthogonal transcriptional regulators based on phiC31 integrase and (ii) the design of a small genetic circuit that connects a glucocorticoid switch to a MYB/bHLH transcriptional activation module.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic genome is organized into nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin. The positions of nucleosomes on DNA regulate protein-DNA interactions and in turn influence DNA-templated events. Despite the increasing number of genome-wide maps of nucleosome position, how global changes in gene expression relate to changes in nucleosome position is poorly understood. We show that in nucleosome occupancy mapping experiments in maize (Zea mays), particular genomic regions are highly susceptible to variation introduced by differences in the extent to which chromatin is digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). We exploited this digestion-linked variation to identify protein footprints that are hypersensitive to MNase digestion, an approach we term differential nuclease sensitivity profiling (DNS-chip). Hypersensitive footprints were enriched at the 5′ and 3′ ends of genes, associated with gene expression levels, and significantly overlapped with conserved noncoding sequences and the binding sites of the transcription factor KNOTTED1. We also found that the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression was linked to tissue-specific hypersensitive footprints. These results reveal biochemical features of nucleosome organization that correlate with gene expression levels and colocalize with functional DNA elements. This approach to chromatin profiling should be broadly applicable to other species and should shed light on the relationships among chromatin organization, protein-DNA interactions, and genome regulation.},

Important thermodynamic concepts underlie the assembly of macromolecular complexes on looped DNA. The effects that this process has on the properties of gene regulation extend beyond the traditional view of DNA looping as a mechanism to increase the affinity of regulatory molecules for their cognate sites. Recent developments indicate that DNA looping can also lead to the suppression of cell-to-cell variability, the control of transcriptional noise, and the activation of cooperative interactions on demand.},

  abstract = {The AT-rich DNA is mostly associated with condensed chromatin, whereas the GC-rich sequence is preferably located in the dispersed chromatin. The AT-rich genes are prone to be tissue-specific (silenced in most tissues), while the GC-rich genes tend to be housekeeping (expressed in many tissues). This paper reports another important property of DNA base composition, which can affect repertoire of genes with high AT content. The GC-rich sequence is more liable to mutation. We found that Spearman correlation between human gene GC content and mutation probability is above 0.9. The change of base composition even in synonymous sites affects mutation probability of nonsynonymous sites and thus of encoded proteins. There is a unique type of housekeeping genes, which are especially unsafe when prone to mutation. Natural selection which usually removes deleterious mutations, in the case of these genes only increases the hazard because it can descend to suborganismal (cellular) level. These are cell cycle-related genes. In accordance with the proposed concept, they have low GC content of synonymous sites (despite them being housekeeping). The gene-centred protein interaction enrichment analysis (PIEA) showed the core clusters of genes whose interactants are modularly enriched in genes with AT-rich synonymous codons. This interconnected network is involved in double-strand break repair, DNA integrity checkpoints and chromosome pairing at mitosis. The damage of these genes results in genome and chromosome instability leading to cancer and other ‘error catastrophes’. Reducing the nonsynonymous mutations, the usage of AT-rich synonymous codons can decrease probability of cancer by above 20-fold.},

 vivo mapping strategies might allow detection of labile constituents

 the bovine DNase I gene into yeast under control of a galactose-responsive promoter.
 Expression of the nuclease leads to DNA degradation and cell death.
 Shorter exposure to the active enzyme allows mapping of chromatin
 structure in whole cells without isolation of nuclei. The validity and
 efficacy of the strategy are demonstrated by footprinting a labile
 repressor bound to its operator. Investigation of the inter-nucleosome

Here we constructed an orthogonal AND gate in Escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from Pseudomonas syringae. The device comprises two co-activating genes hrpR and hrpS controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a σ54-dependent hrpL promoter driving the output. The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate. The circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. The results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts.},

The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intrachromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions, representing a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions, which appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction, are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1, and H3.3. We also identify more than 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not an obvious feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found more than 1000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions analogous to the interior of TADs. The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome.},

However, most bidirectional promoters were cloned individually in the studies of single genes. Here, we initiatively combined RNA-seq data and cDNA microarray data to discover the potential bidirectional promoters in rice genome. Based on the expression level and correlation of each adjacent and oppositely transcribed gene pair, we selected four candidate gene pairs. Then, the intergenic region between each pair was isolated and cloned into a dual reporter vector pDX2181 for functional identification. GUS and GFP assays of the transgenic plants indicated that all the intergenic regions showed bidirectional expression activity in various tissues. Through 5’ and 3’ deletion analysis on one of the above bidirectional promoters, we identified the enhancing region which sharply increased its bidirectional expression efficiency and the essential regions respectively responsible for its 5’ and 3’ basic expression activity. The bidirectional arrangement of the four gene pairs in six gramineous plants was also analyzed, showing the conserved characteristics of the four bidirectional promoters identified in our study. In addition, two novel cis-sequences conserved in the four bidirectional promoters were discovered by bioinformatic identification. Our study proposes a feasible method for selecting, cloning and functionally identifying bidirectional promoters as well as for discovering their bidirectional regulatory regions and conserved sequences in rice.},

  abstract = {To accommodate fluctuating nutrient levels in the soil, plants modulate their metabolism and root development via signaling mechanisms that rapidly reprogram the plant transcriptome. In the case of nitrate, over 1,000 genes are induced or repressed within minutes of nitrate exposure. To identify cis-regulatory elements that mediate these responses, an enhancer screen was performed in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. A 1.8-kb promoter fragment from the nitrate reductase gene NIA1 was identified that acts as a nitrate enhancer when fused to a 35S minimal promoter. Enhancer activity was localized to a 180-bp fragment, and this activity could be enhanced by the addition of a 131-bp fragment from the nitrite reductase promoter. A promoter construct containing the 180- and 131-bp fragments was also induced by nitrite and repressed by ammonium, indicating that it was responsive to multiple nitrogen signals. To identify specific regulatory elements within the 180-bp NIA1 fragment, a transient expression system using agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana was developed. Deletion analysis identified three elements corresponding to predicted binding motifs for homeodomain/E-box, Myb, and Alfin1 transcription factors. A fully active promoter showing nitrate and nitrite enhancer activity equivalent to that of the wild-type 180-bp fragment could be built from these three elements if the spacing between the homeodomain/E-box and Myb-Alfin1 sites was equivalent to that of the native promoter. These findings were validated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and identify a cis-regulatory module containing three elements that comprise a nitrate enhancer in the NIA1 promoter.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A "bidirectional gene pair" is defined as two adjacent genes which are located on opposite strands of DNA with transcription start sites (TSSs) not more than 1000 base pairs apart and the intergenic region between two TSSs is commonly designated as a putative "bidirectional promoter". Individual examples of bidirectional gene pairs have been reported for years, as well as a few genome-wide analyses have been studied in mammalian and human genomes. However, no genome-wide analysis of bidirectional genes for plants has been done. Furthermore, the exact mechanism of this gene organization is still less understood.
RESULTS: We conducted comprehensive analysis of bidirectional gene pairs through the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome and identified 2471 bidirectional gene pairs. The analysis shows that bidirectional genes are often coexpressed and tend to be involved in the same biological function. Furthermore, bidirectional gene pairs associated with similar functions seem to have stronger expression correlation. We pay more attention to the regulatory analysis on the intergenic regions between bidirectional genes. Using a hierarchical stochastic language model (HSL) (which is developed by ourselves), we can identify intergenic regions enriched of regulatory elements which are essential for the initiation of transcription. Finally, we picked 27 functionally associated bidirectional gene pairs with their intergenic regions enriched of regulatory elements and hypothesized them to be regulated by bidirectional promoters, some of which have the same orthologs in ancient organisms. More than half of these bidirectional gene pairs are further supported by sharing similar functional categories as these of handful experimental verified bidirectional genes.
CONCLUSION: Bidirectional gene pairs are concluded also prevalent in plant genome. Promoter analyses of the intergenic regions between bidirectional genes could be a new way to study the bidirectional gene structure, which may provide a important clue for further analysis. Such a method could be applied to other genomes.},

The primary aim of the present study was to obtain first clinical evidence for these psychological and physiological effects. A secondary aim was to achieve some fundamental understanding of the relevant pharmacological processes. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} Endocrinological, physiological, and psychological effects of BEO vapor inhalation on 41 healthy females were tested using a random crossover study design. Volunteers were exposed to 3 experimental setups (rest (R), rest + water vapor (RW), rest + water vapor + bergamot essential oil (RWB)) for 15 min each. Immediately after each setup, saliva samples were collected and the volunteers rested for 10 min. Subsequently, they completed the Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Fatigue Self-Check List. High-frequency (HF) heart rate values, an indicator for parasympathetic nervous system activity, were calculated from heart rate variability values measured both during the 15 min of the experiment and during the subsequent 10 min of rest. Salivary cortisol (CS) levels in the saliva samples were analyzed using ELISA. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} CS of all 3 conditions R, RW, and RWB were found to be significantly distinct (p = 0.003). In the subsequent multiple comparison test, the CS value of RWB was significantly lower when compared to the R setup. When comparing the HF values of the RWB setup during the 10 min of rest after the experiment to those of RW, this parameter was significantly increased (p = 0.026) in the RWB setup for which scores for negative emotions and fatigue were also improved. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} These results demonstrate that BEO inhaled together with water vapor exerts psychological and physiological effects in a relatively short time.},

A single octameric nucleosome can contain two H2A.Z histones (homotypic) or one H2A.Z and one canonical H2A (heterotypic). To elucidate the function of H2A.Z, we generated high-resolution maps of homotypic and heterotypic Drosophila H2A.Z (H2Av) nucleosomes. Although homotypic and heterotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes mapped throughout most of the genome, homotypic nucleosomes were enriched and heterotypic nucleosomes were depleted downstream of active promoters and intron-exon junctions. The distribution of homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes resembled that of classical active chromatin and showed evidence of disruption during transcriptional elongation. Both homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes and classical active chromatin were depleted downstream of paused polymerases. Our results suggest that H2A.Z enrichment patterns result from intrinsic structural differences between heterotypic and homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes that follow disruption during transcriptional elongation.},

Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.},

The level of promoter conservation varies greatly between housekeeping (HK) and tissue-specific (TS) genes, denoting differences in the strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here, we analyzed promoter conservation and evolution to exploit differential regulation between HK and TS genes. The analysis of conserved elements showed CpG islands, short tandem repeats and G-quadruplex sequences are highly enriched in HK promoters relative to TS promoters. In addition, the type and density of regulatory motifs in TS promoters are much higher than HK promoters, indicating that TS genes show more complex regulatory patterns than HK genes. Moreover, the evolutionary dynamics of promoters showed similar evolutionary trend to coding sequences. HK promoters suffer more stringent selective pressure in the long-term evolutionary process. HK genes tend to show increased upstream sequence conservation due to stringent selection pressures acting on the promoter regions. The specificity of TS gene expression may be due to complex regulatory motifs acting in different tissues or conditions. The results from this study can be used to deepen our understanding of adaptive evolution.},

The main advantage to both of these approaches is that only DNA sequences directly bound by a factor within the context of a living cell will be identified. Therefore, artifacts associated with overexpression and/or alterations in signaling pathways are avoided. The first modification we describe, a ChIP cloning strategy, can be used to isolate any genomic fragment specifically associated with a particular factor. It requires no special equipment or reagents other than a high-affinity antibody to be used for immunoprecipitation of the factor of interest. However, it is most useful for the isolation of a small number of genomic targets. In contrast, the second modification, which combines ChIP with specialized CpG microarrays, is ideal for a more global analysis of target genes. Advantages, common problems, and detailed protocols for these two ChIP techniques are discussed.},

  abstract = {We have taken a new approach to the identification of E2F-regulated promoters. After modification of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we cloned nine chromatin fragments which represent both strong and weak in vivo E2F binding sites. Further characterization of three of the cloned fragments revealed that they are bound in vivo not only by E2Fs but also by members of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein family and by RNA polymerase II, suggesting that these fragments represent promoters regulated by E2F transcription complexes. In fact, database analysis indicates that all three fragments correspond to genomic DNA located just upstream of start sites for previously identified mRNAs. One clone, ChET 4, corresponds to the promoter region for beclin 1, a candidate tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that another of the clones, ChET 8, is strongly bound by E2F family members in vivo but does not contain a consensus E2F binding site. However, this fragment functions as a promoter whose activity can be repressed by E2F1. Finally, we demonstrate that the ChET 9 promoter contains a consensus E2F binding site, can be activated by E2F1, and drives expression of an mRNA that is upregulated in colon and liver tumors. Interestingly, the characterized ChET promoters do not display regulation patterns typical of known E2F target genes in a U937 cell differentiation system. In summary, we have provided evidence that chromatin immunoprecipitation can be used to identify E2F-regulated promoters which contain both consensus and nonconsensus binding sites and have shown that not all E2F-regulated promoters show identical expression profiles.},

Transcription factor (TF) DNA sequence preferences direct their regulatory activity, but are currently known for only ∼1\% of eukaryotic TFs. Broadly sampling DNA-binding domain (DBD) types from multiple eukaryotic clades, we determined DNA sequence preferences for {$>$}1,000 TFs encompassing 54 different DBD classes from 131 diverse eukaryotes. We find that closely related DBDs almost always have very similar DNA sequence preferences, enabling inference of motifs for ∼34\% of the ∼170,000 known or predicted eukaryotic TFs. Sequences matching both measured and inferred motifs are enriched in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks and upstream of transcription start sites in diverse eukaryotic lineages. SNPs defining expression quantitative trait loci in Arabidopsis promoters are also enriched for predicted TF binding sites. Importantly, our motif “library” can be used to identify specific TFs whose binding may be altered by human disease risk alleles. These data present a powerful resource for mapping transcriptional networks across eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is an important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Many studies have shown that pRb can negatively regulate the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors during G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, perhaps by serving as a bridge between the E2Fs and transcriptional repressors such as histone deacetylases and methylases. However, pRb has also been shown to localize to discrete DNA foci during S phase, a time at which pRb is thought to be dissociated from E2F. Numerous other DNA binding proteins have been shown to interact with pRb, suggesting that pRb may control progression through S phase by binding to sites in the genome distinct from E2F target gene promoters. To test this hypothesis, we have identified novel pRb binding sites within the human genome using an unbiased approach which relies upon a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarray analysis. To provide the greatest opportunity of finding distinct sets of pRb binding sites, we examined pRb binding in chromatin obtained from human Raji cells synchronized in either G0/G1 phase or S phase. These experiments have allowed us to identify a large set of new genomic binding sites for the pRb protein. We found that some sites are occupied by pRb only during G0/G1 phase, as would be predicted from previous models of pRb function. We also identified sites to which pRb bound only during S phase and other sites which were bound constitutively by pRb. Surprisingly, we found that E2F1 was present at most of the CpG islands bound by pRb, independent of the phase of the cell cycle. Thus, although pRb has the potential to interact with numerous transcription factors, our data suggest that the majority of DNA-bound pRb is recruited to E2F target promoters during both G0/G1 and S phases.},

This process is not well documented in plants due in large measure to difficulties in working with plant systems.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells were briefly labeled with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxy-uridine, and nuclei were subjected to two-parameter flow sorting. We identified more than 5500 loci as initiation regions (IRs), the first regions to replicate in very early S phase. These were classified as strong or weak IRs based on the strength of their replication signals. Strong initiation regions were evenly spaced along chromosomal arms and depleted in centromeres, while weak initiation regions were enriched in centromeric regions. IRs are AT-rich sequences flanked by more GC-rich regions and located predominantly in intergenic regions. Nuclease sensitivity assays indicated that IRs are associated with accessible chromatin. Based on these observations, initiation of plant DNA replication shows some similarity to, but is also distinct from, initiation in other well-studied eukaryotic systems.},

This metric directly corresponds to the minimum number of MCMC rearrangements required to move between trees in common phylogenetic MCMC implementations. We develop a novel graph-based approach to analyze tree posteriors and find that the SPR metric is much more informative than simpler metrics that are unrelated to MCMC moves. In doing so, we show conclusively that topological peaks do occur in Bayesian phylogenetic posteriors from real data sets as sampled with standard MCMC approaches, investigate the efficiency of Metropolis-coupled MCMC (MCMCMC) in traversing the valleys between peaks, and show that conditional clade distribution (CCD) can have systematic problems when there are multiple peaks.},

  abstract = {Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, control development and physiology by regulating gene expression. Mutations that affect the function of these sequences contribute to phenotypic diversity within and between species. With many case studies implicating divergent cis-regulatory activity in phenotypic evolution, researchers have recently begun to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cis-regulatory divergence. Approaches include detailed functional analysis of individual cis-regulatory elements and comparing mechanisms of gene regulation among species using the latest genomic tools. Despite the limited number of mechanistic studies published to date, this work shows how cis-regulatory activity can diverge and how studies of cis-regulatory divergence can address long-standing questions about the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic evolution.},

  abstract = {When the chromatin of Drosophila is examined by digestion with DNAase I or micrococcal nuclease, no general structural organization above the level of the nucleosome is revealed by the cleavage pattern. In contrast, the DNAase I cleavage pattern of specific regions of the Drosophila chromosome shows discrete bands with sizes ranging from a few kilobase pairs (kb) to more than 20 kb. Visualization of such higher order bands was achieved by the use of the Southern blotting technique. The DNAase I-cleaved fragments were transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet after size fractionation by gel electrophoresis. Hybridization was then carried out with radioactively labeled cloned fragments of DNA from D. melanogaster. For the five different chromosomal regions examined, each gives a unique pattern of higher order bands on the autoradiogram; the patterns are different for different regions. Restriction enzyme cleavage of the fragments generated indicates that the preferential DNAase I cleavage sites in chromatin are position-specific. The chromosomal regions bounded by preferential DNAase I cleavage sites are referred to as supranucleosomal or higher order domains for purposes of discussion and analysis. The micrococcal nuclease cleavage pattern of chromatin at specific loci was also examined. In the one case studied in detail, this nuclease also cleaves at position-specific sites.},

All genes encoding the rice seed storage protein glutelin contain the GCN4 motif at similar sites in their 5′ flanking regions. Using a stable homologous transgenic system, we have analysed the promoter of the rice glutelin gene GluB-1 and demonstrated that the GCN4 motif functions as an essential cis-element for endosperm-specific gene expression. Moreover, a 21 bp GluB-1 promoter fragment spanning the GCN4 motif, as a multimer, directed GUS gene expression in endosperm of transgenic rice plants, when fused directly to the core promoter (–46) of CaMV 35S. In transiently transfected rice protoplasts, over a hundred-fold transactivation was observed from the 21 bp sequence by the bZIP type transcriptional activator Opaque-2 (O2) co-expressed under a CaMV 35S promoter. The transactivation was also evident in transgenic plants containing both O2 and the 21 bp sequence/GUS fusion. The O2-mediated activation requires binding of O2 to an intact GCN4 motif. Our results suggest that a bZIP protein functionally similar to O2 may exist in rice and participate in controlling the endosperm-specific expression of GluB-1 through the GCN4 motif.},

  abstract = {We show that NITRATE REGULATORY GENE2 (NRG2), which we identified using forward genetics, mediates nitrate signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. A mutation in NRG2 disrupted the induction of nitrate-responsive genes after nitrate treatment by an ammonium-independent mechanism. The nitrate content in roots was lower in the mutants than in the wild type, which may have resulted from reduced expression of NRT1.1 (also called NPF6.3, encoding a nitrate transporter/receptor) and upregulation of NRT1.8 (also called NPF7.2, encoding a xylem nitrate transporter). Genetic and molecular data suggest that NRG2 functions upstream of NRT1.1 in nitrate signaling. Furthermore, NRG2 directly interacts with the nitrate regulator NLP7 in the nucleus, but nuclear retention of NLP7 in response to nitrate is not dependent on NRG2. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes involved in four nitrogen-related clusters including nitrate transport and response to nitrate were differentially expressed in the nrg2 mutants. A nitrogen compound transport cluster containing some members of the NRT/PTR family was regulated by both NRG2 and NRT1.1, while no nitrogen-related clusters showed regulation by both NRG2 and NLP7. Thus, NRG2 plays a key role in nitrate regulation in part through modulating NRT1.1 expression and may function with NLP7 via their physical interaction.},

X inactivation is known to be regulated in cis by Xite, Tsix, and Xist, but in principle the two Xs must also be regulated in trans to ensure mutually exclusive silencing. Here, we demonstrate that interchromosomal pairing mediates this communication. Pairing occurs transiently at the onset of X inactivation and is specific to the X-inactivation center. Deleting Xite and Tsix perturbs pairing and counting/choice, whereas their autosomal insertion induces de novo X-autosome pairing. Ectopic X-autosome interactions inhibit endogenous X-X pairing and block the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation. Thus, Tsix and Xite function both in cis and in trans. We propose that Tsix and Xite regulate counting and mutually exclusive choice through X-X pairing.},

To understand the promoter architecture of Arabidopsis, we used the combined approach of in silico detection of novel core promoter elements and large-scale determination of transcription start sites (TSSs). To this end, we developed a novel methodology for TSS identification, using a combination of the cap-trapper and massively parallel signature sequencing methods. This technique, CT-MPSS, allowed us to identify 158 237 Arabidopsis TSS tags corresponding to 38 311 TSS loci, which provides an opportunity for quantitative analysis of plant promoters. The expression characteristics of these promoters were analyzed with respect to core promoter elements detected by our in silico analyses, revealing that Arabidopsis promoters contain two main types of elements with exclusive characteristics, the TATA type and the GA type. The TATA-type promoters tend to be associated with the Y Patch and the Inr motif, and cause high expression with sharp-peak TSS clusters. By contrast, the GA type produces broad-type TSS clusters. Unlike mammalian promoters, plant promoters are not associated with CpG islands. However, plant-specific GA-type promoters share some characteristics with mammalian CpG-type promoters.},

Tissue-selective genes are predominantly expressed in one or a few biologically relevant tissue types. Benefitting from the massive gene expression microarray data obtained over the past decades, the properties of housekeeping and tissue-selective genes can now be investigated on a large-scale manner. In this study, we analyzed the topological properties of housekeeping and tissue-selective genes in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, we compared the biological properties and amino acid usage between these two gene groups. The results indicated that there were significant differences in topological properties between housekeeping and tissue-selective genes in the PPI network, and housekeeping genes had higher centrality properties and may play important roles in the complex biological network environment. We also found that there were significant differences in multiple biological properties and many amino acid compositions. The functional genes enrichment and subcellular localizations analysis was also performed to investigate the characterization of housekeeping and tissue-selective genes. The results indicated that the two gene groups showed significant different enrichment in drug targets, disease genes and toxin targets, and located in different subcellular localizations. At last, the discriminations between the properties of two gene groups were measured by the F-score, and expression stage had the most discriminative index in all properties. These findings may elucidate the biological mechanisms for understanding housekeeping and tissue-selective genes and may contribute to better annotate housekeeping and tissue-selective genes in other organisms.},

DNA structural features refine the description of TF binding specificities and provide mechanistic insights into protein-DNA recognition. Existing motif databases contain extensive nucleotide sequences identified in binding experiments based on their selection by a TF. To utilize DNA shape information when analysing the DNA binding specificities of TFs, we developed a new tool, the TFBSshape database (available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/TFBSshape/), for calculating DNA structural features from nucleotide sequences provided by motif databases. The TFBSshape database can be used to generate heat maps and quantitative data for DNA structural features (i.e., minor groove width, roll, propeller twist and helix twist) for 739 TF datasets from 23 different species derived from the motif databases JASPAR and UniPROBE. As demonstrated for the basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain TF families, our TFBSshape database can be used to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, the DNA binding specificities of closely related TFs and, thus, uncover differential DNA binding specificities that are not apparent from nucleotide sequence alone.},

Efforts have focused both on the molecular mechanisms involved in localizing RNAs to particular intracellular targets and on the functional importance (to the cell) of placing certain RNAs at particular cellular sites. In many cases, an understanding of the role of RNA localization seems to be predicated on a careful analysis of how a particular RNA achieves its characteristic distribution. A generalized model of RNA localization usually invokes cellular factors recognizing RNA target sequences. This review will focus on several systems in which cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors recognizing these elements are involved in RNA localization: how they have been defined, how they relate to each other, and how they interact and function to help achieve defined intracellular localization. Conservation of both RNA elements and protein factors across species suggests that RNA localization is probably a fundamental cellular process.},

Our analyses uncovered not only evidence for PAV and positional variation (PosV) but that diversity in CNS is non-random, with variants shared across different accessions.

Here, we report that a more robust beta-catenin binding region localizes 1.4 kb downstream from the c-Myc transcriptional stop site. This site was discovered using a genome-wide method for identifying transcription factor binding sites termed serial analysis of chromatin occupancy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-scanning assays demonstrate that the 5' enhancer and the 3' binding element are the only beta-catenin and TCF4 binding regions across the c-Myc locus. When placed downstream of a simian virus 40-driven promoter-luciferase construct, the 3' element activated luciferase transcription when introduced into HCT116 cells. c-Myc transcription is negligible in quiescent HCT116 cells but is induced when cells reenter the cell cycle after the addition of mitogens. Using these cells, we found that beta-catenin and TCF4 occupancy at the 3' enhancer precede occupancy at the 5' enhancer. Association of c-Jun, beta-catenin, and TCF4 specifically with the downstream enhancer underlies mitogen stimulation of c-Myc transcription. Our findings indicate that a downstream enhancer element provides the principal regulation of c-Myc expression.},

  abstract = {Changes in cis-regulatory element composition that result in novel patterns of gene expression are thought to be a major contributor to the evolution of lineage-specific traits. Although transcription factor binding events show substantial variation across species, most computational approaches to study regulatory elements focus primarily upon highly conserved sites, and rely heavily upon multiple sequence alignments. However, sequence conservation based approaches have limited ability to detect lineage-specific elements that could contribute to species-specific traits. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that utilizes a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. Our model was applied to analyze the evolution of binding sites based on the ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1) along the lineage toward human after human-mouse common ancestor. We estimate that a substantial fraction of binding sites (∼58–79\% for each factor) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse. Over 15\% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. Such elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways, and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. These results support the ability of our method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.},

  abstract = {The transient gene expression system using Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts has proven an important and versatile tool for conducting cell-based experiments using molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic approaches to analyze the functions of diverse signaling pathways and cellular machineries. A well-established protocol that has been extensively tested and applied in numerous experiments is presented here. The method includes protoplast isolation, PEG–calcium transfection of plasmid DNA and protoplast culture. Physiological responses and high-throughput capability enable facile and cost-effective explorations as well as hypothesis-driven tests. The protoplast isolation and DNA transfection procedures take 6–8 h, and the results can be obtained in 2–24 h. The cell system offers reliable guidelines for further comprehensive analysis of complex regulatory mechanisms in whole-plant physiology, immunity, growth and development.},

  abstract = {The positioning of nucleosomes along chromatin has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells, because packaging DNA into nucleosomes affects sequence accessibility. We developed a tiled microarray approach to identify at high resolution the translational positions of 2278 nucleosomes over 482 kilobases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA, including almost all of chromosome III and 223 additional regulatory regions. The majority of the nucleosomes identified were well-positioned. We found a stereotyped chromatin organization at Pol II promoters consisting of a nucleosome-free region ∼200 base pairs upstream of the start codon flanked on both sides by positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free sequences were evolutionarily conserved and were enriched in poly-deoxyadenosine or poly-deoxythymidine sequences. Most occupied transcription factor binding motifs were devoid of nucleosomes, strongly suggesting that nucleosome positioning is a global determinant of transcription factor access.
The proteins that pack DNA into the yeast nucleus are usually found next to genes, whereas large regulatory regions, which have evolved little, are left exposed.

It is therefore interesting to know where the TFBSs of a gene are likely to locate in the promoter region. Here we studied the positional distribution of TFBSs in Arabidopsis thaliana, for which many known TFBSs are now available. We developed a method to identify the locations of TFBSs in the promoter sequences of genes in A. thaliana. We found that the distribution is nearly bell-shaped with a peak at 50 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and 86\% of the TFBSs are in the region from −1,000 bp to +200 bp with respect to the TSS. Our distribution was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and microarray data and DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing data. When TF families were considered separately, differences in positional preference were observed between TF families. Our study of the positional distribution of TFBSs seems to be the first in a plant.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the DNA and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the DNA in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential DNA-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear DNA. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special “pioneer transcription factors” can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the DNA, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor FoxA occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.},

  abstract = {Predictive control of gene expression is an essential tool for developing synthetic biological systems. The current toolbox for controlling gene expression in cyanobacteria is a barrier to more in-depth genetic analysis and manipulation. Towards relieving this bottleneck, this work describes the use of synthetic biology to construct an anhydrotetracycline-based induction system and adapt a trans-acting small RNA (sRNA) system for use in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. An anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter was developed to maximize intrinsic strength and dynamic range. The resulting construct, PEZtet, exhibited tight repression and a maximum 32-fold induction upon addition of anhydrotetracycline. Additionally, a sRNA system based on the Escherichia coli IS10 RNA-IN/OUT regulator was adapted for use in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. This system exhibited 70\% attenuation of target gene expression, providing a demonstration of the use of sRNAs for differential gene expression in cyanobacteria. These systems were combined to produce an inducible sRNA system, which demonstrated 59\% attenuation of target gene expression. Lastly, the role of Hfq, a critical component of sRNA systems in E. coli, was investigated. Genetic studies showed that the Hfq homolog in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 did not impact repression by the engineered sRNA system. In summary, this work describes new synthetic biology tools that can be applied to physiological studies, metabolic engineering, or sRNA platforms in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. Biotechnol.

The interplay between nucleosomes and transcription factors for accessing the underlying DNA sequences is one of the key determinants that affect transcriptional regulation. Moreover, nucleosomes with various packing statuses confer distinct functions in regulating gene expressions in response to various internal or external signals. Therefore, global mapping of nucleosome positions is one informative way to elucidate the relationship between patterns of nucleosome positioning/occupancy and transcriptional regulations. MNase digestion coupled with high-throughput sequencing (MNase-seq) has been utilized widely for global mapping of nucleosome positioning in eukaryotes that have a sequenced genome. We have developed a robust MNase-seq procedure in plants. It mainly includes plant nuclei isolation, treatment of purified nuclei with MNase, gel recovery of MNase-trimmed mononucleosomal DNA with an approximate size of 150 bp, MNase-seq library preparation followed by Illumina sequencing, and data analysis. MNase-seq has already been successfully applied to identify genome-wide nucleosome positioning in model plants, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana.},

Here we developed a dynamic sensor-regulator system (DSRS) to produce fatty acid–based products in Escherichia coli, and demonstrated its use for biodiesel production. The DSRS uses a transcription factor that senses a key intermediate and dynamically regulates the expression of genes involved in biodiesel production. This DSRS substantially improved the stability of biodiesel-producing strains and increased the titer to 1.5 g/l and the yield threefold to 28\% of the theoretical maximum. Given the large number of natural sensors available, this DSRS strategy can be extended to many other biosynthetic pathways to balance metabolism, thereby increasing product titers and conversion yields and stabilizing production hosts.},

We find that pericentromeric heterochromatin, repetitive sequences, and regions producing small interfering RNAs are heavily methylated. Unexpectedly, over one-third of expressed genes contain methylation within transcribed regions, whereas only ∼5\% of genes show methylation within promoter regions. Interestingly, genes methylated in transcribed regions are highly expressed and constitutively active, whereas promoter-methylated genes show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression. Whole-genome tiling-array transcriptional profiling of DNA methyltransferase null mutants identified hundreds of genes and intergenic noncoding RNAs with altered expression levels, many of which may be epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation.},

Nucleosomes strongly prefer yeast DNA over Escherichia coli DNA, indicating that the yeast genome evolved to favor nucleosome formation. Many yeast promoter and terminator regions intrinsically disfavor nucleosome formation, and nucleosomes assembled in vitro show strong rotational positioning. Nucleosome arrays generated by the ACF assembly factor have fewer nucleosome-free regions, reduced rotational positioning and less translational positioning than obtained by intrinsic histone-DNA interactions. Notably, nucleosomes assembled in vitro have only a limited preference for specific translational positions and do not show the pattern observed in vivo. Our results argue against a genomic code for nucleosome positioning, and they suggest that the nucleosomal pattern in coding regions arises primarily from statistical positioning from a barrier near the promoter that involves some aspect of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II.},

Here, we present the co-compartmentation of biosynthesis and storage via a synthetic droplet as an effective new strategy to improve the bioproduct yield, with squalene as a model compound. A hydrophobic protein was designed and introduced into the tobacco chloroplast to generate a synthetic droplet for terpene storage. Simultaneously, squalene biosynthesis enzymes were introduced to chloroplasts together with the droplet-forming protein to co-compartmentalize the biosynthesis and storage of squalene. The strategy has enabled a record yield of squalene at 2.6 mg/g fresh weight without compromising plant growth. Confocal fluorescent microscopy imaging, stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, and droplet composition analysis confirmed the formation of synthetic storage droplet in chloroplast. The co-compartmentation of synthetic storage droplet with a targeted metabolic pathway engineering represents a new strategy for enhancing bioproduct yield.},

Describing these regulatory elements and understanding how they evolve represent major challenges for biologists. Advances in the ability to survey genome-scale DNA sequence data are providing unprecedented opportunities to use evolutionary models and computational tools to identify functionally important elements and the mode of selection acting on them in multiple species. This chapter reviews some of the current methods that have been developed and applied on noncoding DNA, what they have shown us, and how they are limited. Results of several recent studies reveal that a significantly larger fraction of noncoding DNA in eukaryotic organisms is likely to be functional than previously believed, implying that the functional annotation of most noncoding DNA in these organisms is largely incomplete. In Drosophila, recent studies have further suggested that a large fraction of noncoding DNA divergence observed between species may be the product of recurrent adaptive substitution. Similar studies in humans have revealed a more complex pattern, with signatures of recurrent positive selection being largely concentrated in conserved noncoding DNA elements. Understanding these patterns and the extent to which they generalize to other organisms awaits the analysis of forthcoming genome-scale polymorphism and divergence data from more species.},

  abstract = {Background
First pass methods based on BLAST match are commonly used as an initial step to separate the different phylogenetic histories of genes in microbial genomes, and target putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This will continue to be necessary given the rapid growth of genomic data and the technical difficulties in conducting large-scale explicit phylogenetic analyses. However, these methods often produce misleading results due to their inability to resolve indirect phylogenetic links and their vulnerability to stochastic events.

Results
A new computational method of rapid, exhaustive and genome-wide detection of HGT was developed, featuring the systematic analysis of BLAST hit distribution patterns in the context of a priori defined hierarchical evolutionary categories. Genes that fall beyond a series of statistically determined thresholds are identified as not adhering to the typical vertical history of the organisms in question, but instead having a putative horizontal origin. Tests on simulated genomic data suggest that this approach effectively targets atypically distributed genes that are highly likely to be HGT-derived, and exhibits robust performance compared to conventional BLAST-based approaches. This method was further tested on real genomic datasets, including Rickettsia genomes, and was compared to previous studies. Results show consistency with currently employed categories of HGT prediction methods. In-depth analysis of both simulated and real genomic data suggests that the method is notably insensitive to stochastic events such as gene loss, rate variation and database error, which are common challenges to the current methodology. An automated pipeline was created to implement this approach and was made publicly available at: https://github.com/DittmarLab/HGTector. The program is versatile, easily deployed, has a low requirement for computational resources.

Conclusions
HGTector is an effective tool for initial or standalone large-scale discovery of candidate HGT-derived genes.

  abstract = {Increasing the yield potential of the major food grain crops has contributed very significantly to a rising food supply over the past 50 years, which has until recently more than kept pace with rising global demand. Whereas improved photosynthetic efficiency has played only a minor role in the remarkable increases in productivity achieved in the last half century, further increases in yield potential will rely in large part on improved photosynthesis. Here we examine inefficiencies in photosynthetic energy transduction in crops from light interception to carbohydrate synthesis, and how classical breeding, systems biology, and synthetic biology are providing new opportunities to develop more productive germplasm. Near-term opportunities include improving the display of leaves in crop canopies to avoid light saturation of individual leaves and further investigation of a photorespiratory bypass that has already improved the productivity of model species. Longer-term opportunities include engineering into plants carboxylases that are better adapted to current and forthcoming CO(2) concentrations, and the use of modeling to guide molecular optimization of resource investment among the components of the photosynthetic apparatus, to maximize carbon gain without increasing crop inputs. Collectively, these changes have the potential to more than double the yield potential of our major crops.},
